Around 35,000-40,000 tourists from Gujarat take up holidays to Europe every year which mainly include Germany , France and Switzerland. \"Being the top most tourist destination, tourism will take a hit in near future. France, especially Paris and Germany , form a core of any Europe tours. Across India around 6-7 lakh Indians visit France. However, we will have to wait and watch before we can gauge the overall impact on tourism as season for travel to Europe starts after March,\" said a citybased travel operator. Another travel operator said, \"The peak season for visiting Europe is from April to September. There will be some impact on bookings for summer holidays next year due to the attacks.\" Theophilus said, \"Germany attracts highest number of Indian tourists in Europe with at least 12% from Gujarat.

Inspector general of Kolhapur range Sanjay Verma has asked the squads to keep strict watch over the travellers; especially those who were there in the past three to four months. They have been asked to collect details such as the names, profession, livelihood business and what these people are engaged in currently. Verma recently gave these instructions to all the district superintendents. They have also been asked to communicate with the immigration department to know more about the travellers in the region. Some of the sensitive areas such as Ichalkaranji, Satara, Karad and Solapur city which have history of communal conflicts are under strict vigilance, according to a senior police official. More importance is being given to identify travellers from these cities and towns and to get information on what they are doing after coming back, an official said. Following intelligence reports that Syria-based terror group Islamic State (IS) may lure Indian youths, the government has started to implement precautionary measures in the districts. The vigilance was increased since last year when a couple of youngsters from Mumbai found engaged with the IS. It is not that we should look at every traveller with suspicion. However, we must have the complete data of people travelling from our area to the conflict region. That is why we have started collecting information. The immigration department will be requested to provide details of travellers from these districts. Once the information is received, we will ask all the district heads to monitor the people whose travelling found suspicious, an official said. When contacted, Verma confirmed that the anti-terrorism squads have been asked to keep close watch over travellers returning from conflict zone. Firearms seizures up: This year, record 70 firearms were seized in Kolhapur, Pune Rural, Sangli, Satara and Solapur, the police said. Usually, 10 to 20 illegally possessed firearms gets seized every year. The ammunition of these arms are identical to those produced in ordinance factories. Pune rural and Sangli are on top in the firearm seizures. We have recovered 70 firearms till November... Most of them were purchased from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The manufacturing has so much precision that they look like foreign-made firearms. The increase in illegal firearm distribution has been increased this year and we are trying to find out whether these firearms have there is any link beyond international borders, a senior official told TOI. According to investigators, the ammunition might have been bought in auction from the ordinance factory and instead of using it for furnace, it is being made available to buyers through illegal dealers. In September, the Pune rural police seized a sophisticated carbine from criminal Kisan Pardeshi of Lonavla. During investigations he told the police that the carbine was purchased at Rs 2.5 lakh from a dealer in Uttar Pradesh. What has shocked police is the way Pardeshi easily bought the firearm. We are leaving no stones unturned in illegal firearms cases considering the rampant cases of terrorist attacks across the world in which sophisticated weapons are being used, an official said.","source":"toi","title":"West Asia returnees come under lens after Paris attack","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/West-Asia-returnees-come-under-lens-after-Paris-attack/articleshow/49866267.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-21","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Ranchi: After terror attacks in Paris, intelligence bureau has issued warnings to Jharkhand police against possible collaboration between IS and sleeper cells of Indian Mujahideen, Jamat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh and Lashkar-e-Taiba who use Jharkhand to park terrorists. In past terrorists harboring in Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Hazaribag and Santhal Pargana (division) have been arrested in connection with blasts in different parts of the country. The ministry of home affairs has sent an alert to the state police and asked it to keep all district SPs vigilant about possible collaborations. Police spokesperson and ADG (operations and law and order) S N Pradhan said the state police have received intelligence inputs from MHA. The inputs came recently. It has been promptly shared with all SPs with instructions to take it with all seriousness. A few districts which has a background of terrorist activities have been instructed to be extra careful about the alert, Pradhan said. A senior police official said the Paris terrorist attacks have left sufficient indications to calculate that IS might have designs against India. Terrorist sleeper cells have been active in Jharkhand in the last one decade. Suspected terrorists belonging to IM, JMB and L-eT have been arrested from Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Pakur, Hazaribag and other districts. The Ranchi based sleeper cell of IM had planned and executed blasts at Narendra Modi rally at Patna's Gandhi maidan in 2013. Police officials believe Jharkhand has high risk of vulnerability to IS designs as its northeastern border is close to Bangladesh. In September 2015 police arrested JMB second-in-command Tariqul Islam alias Sadiq alias Sumon from Ramgarh, a district which neighbors Ranchi. The arrest revealed that JMB was using Jharkhand as its hinding ground because its key man Rejaul Karim was arrested from Sahebganj railway station (close to Bangladesh border) in January (2015). There are apprehensions IS might collaborate with local units of these terrorist groups in Jharkhand. We have to be alert against it, Pradhan said. A police officer said Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad and Bokaro are in focus of the state police, apart from Hazaribag and Santhal Pargana (division). Police did not share details of security beef-up, but sources said the inter-state buses, inter-state border with West Bengal, Bihar, UP, Odisha and Chhatisgarh are on the radar of the state agencies.

Among them was a man lying amid overturned chairs and tables. David, who asked to be called just by his first name, lay him down. The man did not look to have massive injuries, but appeared unconscious, so David began CPR, the cardiopulmonary resuscitation he'd been trained for. When he tore open the man's t-shirt, David quickly realized that what he initially thought was a gas explosion at the cafe close to the Bataclan music hall where gunmen killed 89, was actually something far worse. There were wires; one white, one black, one red and one orange. Four different colors, he told Reuters. I knew then he was a suicide bomber. The man David was trying to resuscitate was Brahim Abdeslam, one of those involved in a series of deadly attacks that killed 130 people at bars, restaurants, a soccer stadium and a music hall. No one other than Abdeslam died at the cafe. In an amateur video obtained by Reuters, two men can be seen from outside the cafe trying to resuscitate a man lying on the floor. One is believed to be David, the other is unknown. Near them, another person lies wounded on the floor amid spatters of blood. The first wire I saw was red. I think that was the detonator, David said. There was something at the end. As soon as he realized the person he was trying to save had just tried to kill him, David says the fire services arrived. Among them was a fireman he knew. He told him what he had just seen. He looked at me and started shouting for everyone to evacuate, he said.

He had been having dinner with a friend that Friday night. When the waitress brought their dishes, the explosion went off. There was a huge flame, there was dust, he said. I immediately thought it was the heaters. I screamed, 'cut off the gas'. There was panic, people started running out ... I left the dining area and went on to the terrace. He first helped a woman, then a young man lying on a table, conscious but bleeding. A helper took over and David went to Abdeslam. At this point, I never thought he was a suicide bomber, he was a customer like everyone else, he said. I thought that after the gas explosion, he must have gotten hurt. David says he did not see Abdeslam walk into the restaurant. He believes he had been sitting at the terrace when he detonated the bomb. He had a large opening on his side, about 30 cms (11.8 inches), he said. When you lift a t-shirt and you see wires, you know that's not normal. David says police told him that Abdeslam's bomb had not fully exploded.","source":"toi","title":"In Paris attack, nurse discovers the man he tried to save was bomber","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/In-Paris-attack-nurse-discovers-the-man-he-tried-to-save-was-bomber/articleshow/49867696.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-21","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"37.09024","longtitude":"-95.712891","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"No 'Credible' Threat to US of Paris-Style Attack: FBI","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/no-credible-threat-to-us-of-paris-style-attack-fbi-1245429"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-20","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"37.09024","longtitude":"-95.712891","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"FBI Director Says No Credible Threat of Paris-type Attack in US","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fbi-director-says-no-credible-threat-of-paris-type-attack-in-us-1245485"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-20","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Paris Police Saw Woman Bomber Meet Attack Chief Abaaoud: Source","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-police-saw-woman-bomber-meet-attack-chief-abaaoud-source-1245721"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-20","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Nagpur: Joining the chorus of condemnation after the terror attacks in Paris, Muslim religious experts, including maulanas, in Nagpur have issued statements that violence against the innocent was an un-Islamic act. Maulana Siraj of Jamat-e-ulema e-Hind in Nagpur said even as a formal statement is yet to be issued from the organization, he personally condemned the attack in Paris. About Islamic State (IS), he said it is against the tenets of Islam to attack innocent people. Attacks in places like stadiums or other areas where a large number of people have gathered unarmed and unaware cannot be justified. If IS has been conducting such attacks it is certainly not justified in the religion, said Siraj. He said a formal statement against the attacks could not be issued so far because some key members were away for personal work. The statement will be released soon after they return. IS has also succeeded in wooing some Indian youths to its side. This is indeed unfortunate and Indian Muslims should not fall in the trap and rather understand Islam in its true essence, which does not approve acts like those carried out by IS or other similar organizations, said Shamim Ejaz, an Urdu journalist. Dr Abdul Gafoor Parekh, a religious expert of moderate views, said, Usually, such acts of terror are justified by linking them to the atrocities carried out by Isreal in Palestine. While the almighty never tolerates any kind of oppression, any religion which teaches oppression is evil. Gafoor said his organization has also spoken against earlier such events like the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai or destruction of Buddha idols in Bamiyan by Taliban. He said there are several quotations in the Koran itself which are convincing enough that Islam does not support violence of any kind. Haji Abdul Wahab Parekh, a member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said, the act by IS is certainly not acceptable. However, as retribution to Paris attacks it is also not justifiable to bomb innocent civilians. Violence should not be dealt with violence alone, he said. Parekh said Islam does not approve forced conversions too. There are several religions in the world and each person has a freedom to follow according to his choice. Islam teaches that killing of innocents is a crime against entire humanity. The IS is killing innocents in the name of religion, and it should be denounced, said maulana Abdul Basit, head of Jamate-e-ulema-e-Hind's city unit.","source":"toi","title":"Muslim leaders, maulanas condemn Paris attack","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Muslim-leaders-maulanas-condemn-Paris-attack/articleshow/49864926.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-20","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Band in Paris Attack Urges Compassion, Halts Shows","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/band-in-paris-attack-urges-compassion-halts-shows-1244994"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-19","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"50.503887","longtitude":"4.469936","location":"Belgium"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Belgium Under Fire for Paris Attack 'Blunders'","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/belgium-under-fire-for-paris-attack-blunders-1244967"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-19","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"37.09024","longtitude":"-95.712891","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"US Warned of Paris Attack 'Mastermind' in May","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-warned-of-paris-attack-mastermind-in-may-1244995"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-19","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"null","longtitude":"null","location":"null"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Joints, Beer but Little Religion in Lives of Paris Attack Brothers","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joints-beer-but-little-religion-in-lives-of-paris-attack-brothers-1245341"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-19","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Abdelhamid Abaaoud, Suspected Paris Attack Mastermind, Identified Among Terrorists Killed in Raid","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-attack-mastermind-identified-among-terrorists-killed-in-raid-prosecutor-1245259"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-19","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Woman Sacrifices Life to Save Son During Paris Attack","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/woman-sacrifices-life-to-save-son-during-paris-attack-1245160"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-19","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"PARIS: \u200bAbdelhamid Abaaoud, the Belgian suspected to have masterminded the 1311 terror attacks, was killed during a seven-hour siege in a northern Paris suburb on Wednesday, the Washington Post said.

An assessment published by the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, in coordination with the FBI, makes reference to and pictures Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected ringleader of Friday's coordinated suicide bombings and shootings in the French capital that killed at least 129 people. The report focuses on the lesson learned from a plot disrupted by Belgian authorities in January in several cities and called it the first instance in which a large group of terrorists possibly operating under ISIL direction has been discovered. It added that the plot may indicate that the group has developed the capability to launch more complex operations in the West, as opposed to so-called lone wolf attacks or assaults by smaller or less sophisticated groups. The threat was more acute in Europe than the United States, the assessment said, but cautioned that we cannot discount the possibility for potential complex attacks here in the Homeland. The report, citing European media, called Abaaoud the purported leader of the Belgian plotters and said he directed operations from a safehouse in Athens using a cell phone, possibly in a bid to hide his involvement.

But in Hyderabad and its suburbs, important public places continue to be vulnerable. In fact, security agencies privately say they are neither prepared nor equipped to handle a Paris-like situation. Ever since the ISIS influence began, more than 10 educated youth have been nabbed by the Telangana intelligence officials for trying to join the ranks of the terrorist organization. Local sympathizers continue to get nabbed, though officials are tight-lipped about this. In such a scenario, IT parks, shopping malls, eateries and tourist attractions in the city are sitting ducks, thanks to the lack of armed personnel in these places. As of now, the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) is the only location that seems prepared to react immediately to terror strikes.

It also has a Standard Operating Pro cedure (SOP) which guides them on who should be alerted and which force should react first. Other areas of the city continue to remain at risk. Even though companies in the IT corridor have been sensitized about security threats, none of them have armed their private security guards. In fact, the Telangana police had offered these companies arms licence some months ago, but they failed to respond. The police, however, have given some training to the security personnel guarding these companies and made them participate in drills on how to react to a crisis situation.The drills were conducted in Hi-Tec City, Cyber Pearl, RGIA and in some malls in Cyberabad. In Hyderabad, OCTOPUS conducted drills at Charminar, Secretariat and some other locations. Despite this, decoy operations by police have exposed security loopholes in most public places times and again. We are doing our best to face any eventuality . During the sensitization programmes, all security personnel at IT companies and malls were made aware about how to react in a crisis. It would have been better if the companies in the IT corridor respond better as there is a further need to strengthen security, especially on the front of providing arms to their security personnel, Cyberabad police commissioner C V Anand said.","source":"toi","title":"City unprepared to tackle Paris-like terror attack","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/City-unprepared-to-tackle-Paris-like-terror-attack/articleshow/49824856.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-18","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKNOWN","source":"toi","title":"I was in Paris on the morning of the terror attack","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/I-was-in-Paris-on-the-morning-of-the-terror-attack/articleshow/49826118.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-18","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Some sent prayers for the victims of the Paris attacks on Friday , others changed their profile pictures on social networking site to the French flag.

After the Paris attacks, police quickly traced the terrorists to Brussels, raiding addresses in the Molenbeek district and arresting seven suspects. It was in the grimy, run-down, neighbourhood that investigators believe the Paris plot was hatched by Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Belgian-born son of an immigrant shopkeeper from Morocco. Abaaoud is only part of a web of Belgium-based foot soldiers, whose exploits have left a trail of death across Europe. And beyond: around 500 young Belgians have gone to Syria to fight for jihadist groups like ISIS \u2014 per capita, no other European country has sent more foreign fighters. READ ALSO: Police raids in France and Belgium seek Paris attack suspects Why is Belgium at the heart of Europe's most destructive wave of terrorism in a generation? There is no single explanation, but rather a number of ingredients, from post-war immigration from north Africa, hate preachers, ghettos, poverty, and marginalision. There is also a belated realization by the Belgian authorities that complacency towards extremism has allowed the pernicious Islamic influences to fester. Islamist extremism has a long history in Belgium. While there have been few attacks on Belgian soil, there has been significant involvement in atrocities elsewhere. There are links to the murder of the Afghan anti-Taliban fighter Ahmed Shah Masoud \u2014 just before the September 2001 attacks in the US \u2014 and the Groupe Islamique Marocain Combattant (GICM), which had a major role in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. In 2005, Muslim convert Muriel Degauque, became the first known female Western suicide bomber, when she blew herself up in Iraq. READ ALSO: Barack Obama calls Islamic State 'the face of evil' Some of the problems are thought to have deeper roots, including a 1970s decision to allow Saudi Arabia to send preachers with fundamentalist, Salafist teachings to Moroccan immigrants. The Great Mosque of Brussels is still owned by the Saudi royal family. However, it was the Syrian civil war that gave the jihadists their recent fillip. Belgium's chief police commissioner Catherine de Bolle says that of 474 Belgians linked with the Syria conflict, about 130 have returned, 77 have died in the conflict, and more than 200 are still over there. Intelligence officials say that Syria \u2014 in particular, the ultra-violent ideology of ISIS \u2014 represents a paradigm shift from seeking a regional caliphate to global Jihad. The Belgian connection was laid bare in the recent trial in Antwerp of Fouad Belkacem, the leader of the radical group Sharia4Belgium, which claimed to be an Islamic information network, but was actively recruiting fighters for Syria. Belkacem, a 32-year-old Islamic radical, was accused by prosecutors of belonging to a terrorist group and brainwashing young people. In February, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. It was the largest trial of its kind in the country: 44 other members of Sharia4Belgium were given sentences ranging between three and 12 years, although most of them in absentia, as they were in Syria. The trial revealed how sophisticated the underground Jihadist pipeline had become. Although Belgian security services have infiltrated mosques more effectively in past decade \u2014 in part, after discovering a Belgian connection to the 2005 Madrid bombings \u2014 Sharia4Belgium and others have found ways to evade surveillance by using internet chat rooms and social media. Almost all the trails linking Belgium to terrorism find their way to Molenbeek, the deprived Brussels commune. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, who has promised a crackdown on extremism in the country, says there is a huge problem in Molenbeek, and has suggested closing some of the commune's 22 mosques. The situation is not helped by a fractured law enforcement \u2014 the Brussels region has 19 communes and operationally independent police zones \u2014 and a shortage of Arabic speakers in the Belgian intelligence services. Bilal Benyaich from the Itinera Institute, a Brussels-based think tank, says Molenbeek is a melting pot of malign elements. You have big Muslim communities boxed into tight housing in poor neighbourhoods, he says. Benyaich says that many young Muslims feel marginalized from mainstream Belgian life. This real or perceived sense of exclusion is combined with extreme Islam, he says. All these problems come together in a complex process of indoctrination and alienation.","source":"toi","title":"Paris attack: Why Belgium is at the heart of a destructive wave of terror in Europe","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/Paris-attack-Why-Belgium-is-at-the-heart-of-a-destructive-wave-of-terror-in-Europe/articleshow/49811027.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-17","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"THANE: Over 500 members from the Muslim community in Mumbra staged a protest on Monday to condemn the Paris terror attacks by burning the effigy of ISIS at Amrut Nagar near Kausa.

Republican Governors Greg Abbott of Texas, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Mike Pence of Indiana, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Phil Bryant of Mississippi said their states would no longer help support the Obama administration's goal of accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees in the coming years. Texas cannot participate in any program that will result in Syrian refugees - any one of whom could be connected to terrorism - being resettled in Texas, Abbott said in an open letter to US President Barack Obama on Monday. Neither you nor any federal official can guarantee that Syrian refugees will not be part of any terroristic activity. However, it was unclear what authority governors had to stop admitting refugees into their states, legal experts said. The federal government has the power over immigration. If they admit Syrian refugees, they're here, said Deborah Anker, a professor of law at Harvard Law School who specializes in immigration issues. People aren't going to the (state) border. The federal government is going to bring them in. The decisions to stop accepting refugees from Syria came three days after gunmen and suicide bombers believed to be part of the Islamic State militant group killed 129 people in a series of coordinated attacks in Paris, the worst such event in France since World War Two. A Syrian passport found near the body of one of the attackers showed that its holder passed through Greece in October, raising concern that the attackers had entered Europe amid the wave of refugees fleeing that country's four-year civil war. The United States admitted 1,682 Syrian refugees in the federal fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a sharp jump from the 105 admitted a year earlier. Texas, California and Michigan accepted the largest number of people fleeing the war. Secretary of State John Kerry in September said the United States would increase the number of refugees it takes in from all nations by 15,000 per year over the next two years, bringing the total to 100,000 a year by 2017. 'They flee terror' Some of the charitable groups that work to resettle refugees criticized the moves, saying that the governors are wrongly targeting people who are fleeing violence, not trying to spread it. For these governors to falsely assert that the US refugee admissions program places their states at risk is utterly preposterous, the Reverend John McCullough, chief executive of the Church World Service, one of nine charitable groups that works with the US's Office of Refugee Resettlement, said in a statement. Mark Hetfield, chief executive of the Jewish nonprofit refugee service HIAS questioned the idea that refugees posed a threat. As a rule, refugees do not bring terror, they flee terror, Hetfield said. Refugees resettled to the United States are already subject to multiple layers of security screenings. Alabama and Michigan said they would no longer accept Syrian refugees on Sunday. Michigan's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, described his state, which has a large Arab-American population, as welcoming but said the risk associated with admitting Syrian refugees was too high. Our first priority is protecting the safety of our residents, Snyder said on Sunday. Given the terrible situation in Paris, I've directed that we put on hold our efforts to accept new refugees until the US Department of Homeland Security completes a full review of security clearances and procedures. The governors said they were ordering their state departments of health and human services to stop working with Syrian refugees. Jindal also noted that Louisiana State Police were aware of a Syrian refugee already relocated within the state, and directed law enforcement to monitor for possible threats. Jindal is a Republican candidate for president.","source":"toi","title":"Seven US states shut doors to Syrian refugees after Paris attack","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/Seven-US-states-shut-doors-to-Syrian-refugees-after-Paris-attack/articleshow/49810548.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-17","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"KOLKATA: The intellectuals in the Muslim community in Kolkata have strongly condemned the killings of 138 people in Paris on Saturday but warned that the RSS and its affiliates were already using the massacre to derail the debate on rising intolerance in India. According to them, the right wing forces have already activated their propaganda machinery to trigger a public discourse insinuating that Indian Muslims sympathise with the attackers and embarrass the secular forces in the country who have flared up the debate on rising intolerance in the country. Terrorism or terrorists have no religion. Whatever happened in Paris was heinous and we condemn it in strongest possible words, said Qari Fazlur Rahman who leads the Id prayers of over 3 lakh Muslims on Red Road every year. The cleric came into prominence when he had cautioned chief minister Mamata Banerjee over her government's approach to the problems of Muslims during Id prayers in 2011. On Monday, Rahman cautioned that the debate on intolerance should not be stopped by anyone. The people of India are known for their tolerance towards the religious and cultural practices of each other. There are only a handful of people who rake up some issues and try to vitiate the atmosphere. The debate over intolerance should not stop at any cost, said Rahman. Prominent figures from field of academics, theatre, movies and literature have returned their awards in recent weeks to protest what they see as growing attempt to impose a homogenous religious and cultural identity on the entire country and the shrinking space for dissent. Hasnain Imam, a teacher and social worker in the city, feels that the RSS and its affiliates are selecting incidents that complement their narrative of infusing suspicion about the Indian Muslims amongst their counterparts from other religion. The right wing forces want to insinuate that every Indian Muslim is a potential terror recruit. This is in line with their propaganda to alienate the community from other communities, said Imam who condemned the barbaric killings of the innocent French people. Attackers and suicide bombers killed 138 people in co-ordinated attacks across Paris on Saturday. The ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack and described it as an act of war against France. Two sets of separate incidents in recent times have sparked off the debate on intolerance. The first set comprises of murders of writers including Kannada language scholar M M Kalburgi, known to be a liberal. This was followed by the murder of Mohammed Ikhlaque in September for allegedly consuming beef. Ikhlaque, a resident of Bisara in Uttar Pradesh which is stone's throw from the capital, was lynched by a mob after a rumour that the carcass of a calf was found in his backyard. These protests from the illuminati and the civil society have hurt the right wing forces the most attracting international spotlight over concerns if the oldest and biggest democracy was becoming an intolerant nation. There is a concerted effort to embarrass the sympathisers who have raked up the intolerance debate that has exposed them the right wing forces, said Mohammed Qasim who runs an NGO in the slums of Rajabazar to support under privileged children. By blaming Muslims or embarrassing them over the heinous acts committed by the ISIS, there is an effort to alienate them from the mainstream,' said Abdul Aziz, general secretary of the Milli Itehad Parishad, an umbrella organisation of the minorities.","source":"toi","title":"Intellectuals slam Paris attack, fear intolerance rise","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Intellectuals-slam-Paris-attack-fear-intolerance-rise/articleshow/49810092.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-17","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKNOWN","source":"toi","title":"Did Nostradamus predict Paris attack?","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Did-Nostradamus-predict-Paris-attack/articleshow/49814129.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-17","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"null","longtitude":"null","location":"null"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"19 Nationalities Among Victims of Paris Terror Attack: Francois Hollande","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/19-nationalities-among-victims-of-paris-terror-attack-francois-hollande-1244096"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"What Lay Behind ISIS's Attack On Paris, According To Experts","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-lay-behind-isiss-attack-on-paris-according-to-experts-1243787"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"David Beckham: Sympathise With Zinedine Zidane, Patrick Vieira For Missing Match Due to Paris Terror Attack","url":"http://sports.ndtv.com/article/251791"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Obama Calls Paris Events 'An Attack on the Civilized World'","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/obama-calls-paris-events-an-attack-on-the-civilized-world-1243744"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"41.0082376","longtitude":"28.9783589","location":"Istanbul"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"British Jihadist May Have Planned Paris-Style Attack in Istanbul: Sources","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/british-jihadist-may-have-planned-paris-style-attack-in-istanbul-sources-1243740"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"French Ambassador 'Saddened' by Azam Khan's Remarks on Paris Attack","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/french-ambassador-saddened-by-azam-khans-remarks-on-paris-attack-1244016"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"null","longtitude":"null","location":"null"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"World Leaders at G20 Raise Alarm Over Foreign Jihadists After Paris Attack","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/world-leaders-at-g20-raise-alarm-over-foreign-jihadists-after-paris-attack-1243747"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"After Paris, We Know What Mumbai-style Attack Looks Like: British Daily","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/after-paris-we-know-what-mumbai-style-attack-looks-like-british-daily-1244119"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"55.6760968","longtitude":"12.5683371","location":"Copenhagen Vigil"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Up to 20,000 in Copenhagen Vigil for Paris Attack Victims: Police","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/up-to-20-000-in-copenhagen-vigil-for-paris-attack-victims-police-1243742"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"KANPUR: Already struggling hard to regain foothold following long slowdown in business and the beef ban, the tannery owners of the Industrial City have one more reason to worry.

The French authorities said they were seeking Abdeslam Salah, 26, and described him as dangerous. The police warned the public: Do not intervene on your own, under any circumstances. Belgian officials said that his brother Ibrahim had died in the three-hour massacre on Friday night, which killed at least 132 people, and that another brother, Mohamed, was detained on Saturday in the Molenbeek area of Brussels. The carefully coordinated attacks on Friday night, which President Francois Hollande says are the work of the Islamic State, increasingly appear to have involved extensive planning by a network of men with sophisticated weapons who plotted their attack from outside the country. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, after meeting in Paris with his Belgian counterpart, Jan Jambon, said the attackers had prepared abroad and had mobilized a team of participants located on Belgian territory, and who may have benefited \u2014 the investigation will tell us more \u2014 from complicity in France. French officials initially described eight attackers, but on Saturday night said that only seven had died \u2014 six by blowing themselves up and one in a shootout with police. They said on Sunday that they were looking for an eighth man believed to have been involved in the attacks. It was not immediately clear Sunday evening whether Salah was that eighth man. Crucial, if sparse, details about four of the attackers came into view on Sunday. READ ALSO: British jihadist may have planned Paris-style attack in Istanbul, sources say One attacker \u2014 whose nationality is not yet known \u2014 evidently posed as a Syrian migrant. The Serbian newspaper Blic published a photograph of a passport page that identified its holder as Ahmad al-Mohammad, 25, a native of Idlib, Syria. He passed through the Greek island of Leros on October 3 and the Serbian border town of Presevo on October 7, officials in those countries said. It was not clear whether the passport was authentic; the civil war that has sent millions of Syrians fleeing and fueled the rise of the Islamic State has also created a large black market for forged Syrian passports. At least three other attackers were French citizens. Two had been living in the Brussels area, including one in the community of Molenbeek, according to the Belgian authorities. The third was Ismael Omar Mostefai, 29, a native of Courcouronnes, France, who had been living in Chartres, 60 miles southwest of Paris, and who, along with two other gunmen, killed 89 people at the Bataclan concert hall. Mostefai was the middle of five children born to an Algerian father and a Portuguese mother, and he once worked at a bakery, according to a former neighbor at the housing development just outside Chartres where the family used to live. It was a normal family, just like everybody else, said the neighbor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He played with my children. He never spoke about religion. He was normal. He had a joie de vivre. He laughed a lot. For reasons that are unclear, Mostefai changed. It was in 2010, that's when he started to become radicalized, the neighbor said. We don't understand what happened. As the authorities continued to examine Mostefai's motivations and background, other clues emerged from official accounts in France and Belgium. Two vehicles used in the attacks had been rented in Belgium early last week, the federal prosecutor for Brussels announced on Sunday. One of them, a gray Volkswagen Polo, was abandoned near the Bataclan after being used by the three terrorists who died there. READ ALSO: Paris-like attacks may occur again, expert says The other, a black Seat Leon, was found early Sunday morning in the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil. Three Kalashnikov rifles were found inside it. The vehicle may have been used as a getaway car for the shooters at restaurants in central Paris. The Belgian authorities also announced that they had detained seven men. Three of them passed through a roadside check in Cambrai, France, at 9.10am on Saturday, while on the A2 highway heading to Belgium. They made their way to Molenbeek, where the authorities detained them for unknown reasons and seized the car on Saturday afternoon. Fundamental questions remained: how the terrorists, who acted in three synchronized teams, managed to pull off the deadliest terrorist attack in Western Europe since 2004, and whether they received direction from Islamic State leaders in Iraq and Syria, who until now had never taken responsibility for such a large-scale attack in the West. The revelations that three of the attackers were French citizens were likely to exacerbate long-standing fears in France about the place of Muslim immigrants and converts in French society, 10 months after a smaller set of deadly attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, on a kosher grocery and against a police officer. Mostefai was one of three hostage-takers at the Bataclan, and was identified based on a print from his severed finger.

According to the Paris prosecutor, Francois Molins, he was arrested in connection with a series of low-level crimes from 2004 to 2010 and had been under surveillance since 2010, having been flagged in a French security services database as someone who had fallen under the influence of extremist Islamist beliefs. Six of his relatives have been detained for questioning; on Sunday, other relatives told French television that he had been estranged from them after a falling-out. In his Facebook post, Mayor Jean-Pierre Gorges of Chartres expressed despair and frustration. How many deaths will occur before our political leaders understand and take action? he asked, describing the emotion, incomprehension and anger he felt at the deaths. Mayor Gorges called for strong action, without asking questions first. Our leaders don't need to prove they are legitimate; we have elected them, so they take responsibility of the executive power of the republic, he wrote on Facebook. Their duty is to act effectively, and ultimately we don't need to know how.

Afterward, Sarkozy urged decisive action against the Islamic State \u2014 a position Hollande has also taken. We need everybody in order to exterminate Daesh, and especially the Russians, Sarkozy told reporters, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. Russia's president, Vladimir V Putin, is a steadfast ally of Syria's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, and recently began an aerial bombing campaign in Syria. The United States and France say the attacks have not been aimed at the Islamic State, as Putin claims, but at other groups opposing Assad. Sarkozy, who has been known to be tough on immigrants during his tenure as president, cautioned against linking the refugee crisis with the terrorist attacks, but added: We need, together, to rein in the wave of migration ensuing from the Syrian situation. READ ALSO: Indian cities vulnerable to Paris-like attacks, experts say As President Obama and other leaders of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies gathered for a scheduled summit meeting in Antalya, Turkey, on the doorstep of the Syrian crisis, France's president, Francois Hollande, stayed behind in Paris, his nation in mourning. As the investigation proceeded, Obama told reporters in Turkey that the skies have been darkened by the horrific attacks in Paris and pledged that America would support France, its oldest ally. We stand in solidarity with them in hunting down the perpetrators of this crime and bringing them to justice, Obama said after meeting with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at the start of a 10-day trip that will also take him to the Philippines and Malaysia. At the same summit meeting, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said there was no need for a complete review of the bloc's refugee policy in response to the terrorist attacks. Those who organized, who perpetrated the attacks are the very same people who the refugees are fleeing and not the opposite, Agence-France Presse quoted Juncker as saying. And so there is no need for an overall review of the European policy on refugees.","source":"toi","title":"Paris attack: Manhunt for the 'dangerous' 8th suspect under way as investigation widens","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/Paris-attack-Manhunt-for-the-dangerous-8th-suspect-under-way-as-investigation-widens/articleshow/49795411.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.3522219","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"CHENNAI: Residents of Puducherry , including several French nationals, paid homage to the victims of terror at tack in Paris, at the French War Memorial on Gouber Avenue on Sunday.

Over 120 people were killed as terrorists attacked sites throughout the French capital and at the stadium where the soccer match was underway. John Miller, deputy commissioner of Intelligence and Counter-terrorism of the New York Police Department told CNN in an interview, that the Paris attack resembles the Mumbai terrorist attack in terms of low-cost low resources and carried the various features of the 26/11. Bruce Hoffman, head of the national security programme at Georgetown University, in an interview to the popular National Public Radio referred to a call given by al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, five years ago to carry Mumbai-type attack across Europe. The attacks show a level of sophistication we really haven't seen in an urban area since 2008 in the attack in Mumbai, Michael Leiter, former director National Counterterrorism Center, told NBC News. This will be a game changer for how the West looks at this threat, Leiter said. In an interview to Newsmax TV, retired Air Force General Michael Hayden said the Paris violence was certainly a terrorist attack and that our fears have been realised because the assaults greatly mirror the 2008 terrorism in Mumbai. We had great fear that we would see copycat versions of that attack -- and now, I fear that our fears have been realised, and we're seeing that carried out tonight in Paris, Hayden said. It shows the fragility of free societies. It shows the great danger that international terrorism presents to all of us, he said. Brian Michael Jenkins from RAND Corporation told The Press Enterprise newspaper that the Paris attacks were reminiscent of the November 2008 assault on the densely crowded Indian city of Mumbai, where teams linked to an Islamic militant organisation carried out a series of coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days. These sorts of attacks are a matter of determination and the ability to acquire weapons, Jenkins said. In some of these European countries, anyone with criminal connections can acquire an AK-47. It doesn't require a great deal of skill to shoot diners at a restaurant or spectators at a rock concert. You don't need to go through training, he said.
