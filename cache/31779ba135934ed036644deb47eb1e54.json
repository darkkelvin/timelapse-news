The result represented a major leap for Taiwan, which finished 36th in 2013 and 11th last year in the annual index that measures how open governments are in providing key information. However, in a statement on this year\u2019s index, Open Knowledge International said that \u201csignificant progress is still to be made, as Taiwan\u2019s overall score reveals that their data is only 78 percent open.\u201d \u201cCrucial datasets such as government spending, postcodes and land ownership are still closed and inaccessible to citizens,\u201d the British non-profit organization said. Premier Mao Chi-kuo (毛治國) said that open data and value-added applications are an important strategy for promoting good governance, service innovation and overall economic development, and are a solid foundation for the government\u2019s Internet policy, called \u201cide@Taiwan.\u201d Under the policy, concrete goals and plans were drawn up for the nation to become fully digitized by 2020, according to the Executive Yuan. Rounding out the Open Data Index top 10 following Taiwan were the UK, Denmark, Colombia, Finland, Australia, Uruguay, the US, the Netherlands and Norway. The next-highest ranked countries in Asia were India at 19th, South Korea at 23rd and Singapore at 25th. While the top rankings remained dominated by OECD members, three non-OECD nations broke into the top 10 this year for the first time, Open Knowledge said, referring to Taiwan, Colombia and Uruguay. \u201cOverall, whilst there was meaningful improvement in the number of open datasets (from 124 to 154), the percentage of open datasets across all the surveyed countries fell from 11 percent in 2014 to 9 percent in 2015,\u201d the group said. \u201cIt is clear that little progress has been made at the global level.\u201d According to Open Knowledge, the index is the result of civil society collaboration to track the state of open data in countries and places around the world. The index ranks nations based on the availability and accessibility of data in 13 key categories, including national statistics, government budgets, government spending, legislation, election results, procurement tenders and national maps. Other categories are pollution emissions, weather forecasts, company registers, location datasets, water quality and land ownership.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan tops Global Open Data Index","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/12/10/2003634477"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"24.2225023","longtitude":"120.6545022","location":"China"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"China Chips Away at US, Taiwan Semiconductor Dominance","url":"http://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/china-chips-away-at-us-taiwan-semiconductor-dominance-775642"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-09","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"If the US does not pay more attention to the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait, it will be \u201cinviting a war,\u201d an expert on Asian military affairs said on Monday. \u201cOne side is already preparing for such a war,\u201d International Assessment and Strategy Center (IASC) senior fellow Richard Fisher said. He was addressing a Capitol Hill forum \u2014 attended by US Congressional staffers \u2014 on growing Chinese military threats to Taiwan. Fisher said that a central part of the \u201cChina dream\u201d was to become the world\u2019s dominant military power. He said that for Taiwan to deter a Chinese attack on the nation, the US would have to do much more than it is. A new generation of capability has to be made available, Fisher said. He said that China wants to exploit Taiwan and use it as a military base. According to Fisher \u201cthe pressure is going to be on\u201d by the early 2020s and Taipei\u2019s need for submarines was \u201cwithout argument.\u201d He said that Washington should provide fighters to replace Taiwan\u2019s aging French Dassault Mirage 2000s. \u201cIf they can\u2019t afford new F-16s, let us offer them used F-16s, or even a small number of F-35s, which are very expensive, but at least we could start training and building up capacity to a fifth-generation level,\u201d he said. Fisher said that energy weapons could be key to Taiwan\u2019s needs and that 100 railguns could probably \u201ctake down\u201d the bulk of a Chinese missile attack. \u201cIf the Chinese understood that, they wouldn\u2019t launch those missiles in the first place,\u201d he said. A Chinese invasion could look like \u201cthe reverse of Dunkirk\u201d Fisher said, referring to a major World War II evacuation of Allied troops from France. Beijing could probably transport eight to 12 divisions across the Taiwan Strait, he said. He said that China would use thousands of civilian-owned barges and ships. \u201cInstead of rescuing people, this \u2018Dunkirk\u2019 fleet is going to be the invasion force,\u201d he said. Arthur Waldron, a professor of international relations at the University of Pennsylvania, said that since 2009, China had become overbearing and militaristic. \u201cIn other words, she is dangerous,\u201d Waldron said. He said that China is threatening Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam and India. \u201cThat\u2019s an awful lot of countries to be threatening at one time,\u201d Waldron said. He added: \u201cChina fully intends to achieve her goal. She believes that in 10 years time, she is going to own the South China Sea; she is going to be the harbormaster.\u201d \u201cThe US has done nothing that actually slows progress towards this goal,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one has done anything to throw sand in the wheels.\u201d However, the nations under threat are not \u201cpotted plants\u201d he said. \u201cThey are reacting and they are beginning to rearm,\u201d Waldron said. He said that India is already a nuclear power and that others might also go nuclear to stop China. Waldron said the US needed to tell China that if it attacked Taiwan, there would be a strong reaction.

Maurice Poinsot, 83, began doing missionary work in Hualien County\u2019s Yuli Township (玉里) when he was 27 years old. He learned Mandarin, Hoklo (commonly known as Taiwanese), Hakka and Amis to assimilate into the communities. To help other priests learn the Amis language, Poinsot and now-deceased father Louis Pourrias began to compile an Amis-French dictionary, going to Amis villages to conduct research. The dictionary, which mainly records the Amis language in central Hualien and along the east coast, remains an important reference book for studying the Amis language, the ministry said. Huang Meei-jin (黃美金), a professor in the Department of Applied Foreign Languages at Shih Chien University, was also recognized for her efforts in preserving Aboriginal languages. HEALTH New dengue deaths reported Eleven new deaths caused by dengue hemorrhagic fever have taken the death toll to 195 since the outbreak began in May, the Central Epidemic Command Center said yesterday. Among the 11 was a 29-year-old man with cerebral palsy, the youngest person reported to have died from the disease so far this year, it said. The deaths were recorded over the past week in Kaohsiung. They involved six men and five women aged between 29 and 84, the center said, adding that another 24 deaths are being examined to determine whether they were also caused by the disease. CRIME Men arrested over batteries Police in Kaohsiung have arrested two men for allegedly importing fake iPhone batteries and cables from China, while officers raided stores in the southern city that were allegedly selling the products, authorities said yesterday. Acting on tips from the public, police conducted an investigation and searched several stores in Kaohsiung in October. They discovered more than 1,500 fake iPhone parts with a market value of NT$5 million (US$151,345), and arrested two suspects surnamed Lin and Lee. The suspects allegedly imported the fake batteries and cables from Chinese companies. The parts for iPhone 5, 5S and 6 models look almost the same as genuine ones and also came with fake serial number stickers, police said. The fake parts were sold at 80 percent of the price of genuine iPhone parts, police said. SOCIETY Weight-loss success touted More than 8,600 people in Chiayi City this year participated in an annual weight-loss program organized by the city\u2019s Bureau of Health, shedding a combined total of 16 tonnes, the bureau said on Monday. The program had a target of 9.5 tonnes, but the result far exceeded expectations, the bureau said. The program was designed to help participants lose weight on their own, with participants entered into group and individual competitions. Their weights were measured before and after their participation in the events. The person who shed the most weight was a man who lost 24kg in five months, it said. He is to share his experiences in the program at an awards ceremony today, the bureau said. More than 45 percent of adults in the city are overweight or obese, while seven of the top 10 leading causes of death in Chiayi last year were related to obesity, the bureau said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/12/09/2003634404"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-09","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"The defense of Taiwan is probably the most critical and enduring strategic challenge facing US security professionals today, Project 2049 Institute research fellow Ian Easton said on Saturday. \u201cNo other flashpoint is as likely to see the world\u2019s two strongest nations go to war,\u201d Easton told the annual banquet meeting of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs.

Are new trends emerging? Wang Yu-wei (汪毓瑋): Yes. 9/11 is the watershed between old and new terrorism. Older forms of terrorism, such as that of the Irish Republican Army or Spanish ETA [Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, or Basque Country and Freedom, an armed group of the Basque National Liberation Movement], have objectives such as the independence of Northern Ireland or the Basque regions. If they can enter a reasonable and equitable political process with the government, they are willing to negotiate or even make compromises. However, new terrorist organizations, which include al-Qaeda and the IS, wish to build a Sharia state spanning from the Mediterranean to Southeast Asia, that is distinct from existing Muslim-ruled states, such as Saudi Arabia or Indonesia. In the eyes of IS, Saudi Arabia had already absorbed essential qualities of Western democracy, and is therefore a \u201csecular regime.\u201d Older terrorist [organizations] needed to negotiate with the government, and could not use tactics that are excessively cruel or cause too many civilian casualties. Primarily they attacked targets of symbolic value to the state apparatus, such as military personnel, law enforcement, court and civil government officials. Though new terrorists also attack targets that are symbolic of the state apparatus, they do not care about civilians and they even think that attacks on civilians can coerce governments into making concessions or surrender. Causing maximum casualties is their most important objective and therefore they use deliberately cruel tactics to kill as many people as possible and the more people there are in an area, the more likely it will be chosen as a target. [To them] those are necessary sacrifices in a jihad to achieve victory. LT: The US, Russia, France and Germany appear to be joining efforts to fight the IS. What kind of tactics do you think they will use to strike back? How will the situation develop? Wang: The international response includes airstrikes to degrade IS combat capabilities and retaking oil fields, dams, towns and cities. The softer approach is counter-radicalization. The IS has depended on \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d to replenish its numbers. Pull refers to using mosques, jails and the Internet to spread its ideologies and ideas for the purpose of convincing recruits to join it; push refers to the conditions of social injustice and unequal distribution of resources that become an invisible force pushing those who felt uncared for [by society] to the organization. Al-Qaeda and the IS are skillful in building narratives. Therefore, counter-radicalization uses television stations, non-governmental organizations and various activities to publicize the IS narrative. It must be noted that the IS believes in an ultimate war between the Orient and the Occident, a return to the irreconcilable conflict during the age of the Crusades. However, radical Muslims are a minority. They need to recruit moderate Muslims into their organization through [the mechanism of] outrage. Therefore, they use incessant attacks to elicit reaction from nations that were attacked, to facilitate its Internet propaganda campaign: \u201cI am oppressed by Western states because I fight for the ideals and the future of Muslims.

The company said moving the English announcements \u2014 previously broadcast last \u2014 would make travel in Taipei more convenient for foreigners.

WEATHER Pollution high in the south The air quality in Kaohsiung and Pingtung County remained poor yesterday, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said. The PM2.5 indicator in Kaohsiung and Pingtung ranged between level four and level nine on the 10-point scale, the EPA said, adding that the rest of the nation and the outlying islands saw the indicator stay below level four. Level seven or higher on the PM2.5 index, which measures the concentration of pollution by particles 2.5 micrometers or smaller, indicates enough pollution to cause discomfort and health problems, according to the EPA. It was the third consecutive day of high PM2.5 levels for Kaohsiung and neighboring Pingtung, because of a lack of wind to disperse pollutants in the air. Older people and people with chronic lung problems or heart disease should avoid prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical activity in the affected areas, the EPA said. TRANSPORTATION Taipei, Osaka sister stations Taipei Railway Station and West Japan Railway Co\u2019s Osaka Station became sister stations on Friday, with Taipei-Osaka commemorative tickets selling out shortly after going on sale. Taiwan Railways Administration Director-General Chou Yung-hui (周永暉) said that Taipei Railway Station handles more than 500,000 passengers per day and is a transportation hub like Osaka Station. Becoming sister stations would allow the two entities to affirm their friendship, Chou said, adding that the two stations would also introduce mutually beneficial measures in the future.

It was previously believed that the species, commonly referred to as the broad-tailed swallowtail butterfly, belonged to an Asian butterfly genus native to China. Recognized as Taiwan\u2019s \u201cnational butterfly\u201d and known for its rear-protruding hind wings and red crescent mottles, the butterfly is one of only two species of the genus Agehana \u2014 the only class of the Papilionidae family that is native to East Asia. The other species is the Agehana elwesi, a continental butterfly endemic to southern China. Discovered and named by Japanese entomologist Shonen Matsumura in 1936, the broad-tailed swallowtail butterfly had been considered to be closely related to the Agehana elwesi \u2014 to the extent that the butterfly\u2019s status as an independent species had been disputed for more than 70 years, until Taiwanese researchers identified the distinct genetic differences between the continental and insular swallows in 2009 using molecular DNA testing, the Bureau of Forestry said. A team led by National Taiwan University professor Wu Li-wei (吳立偉), National Taiwan Normal University professor Hsu Yu-feng (徐堉峰) and National Sun Yat-sen University professor Yen Sheng-hung (顏聖紘) sampled four specific genes from a total of 86 species within the Papilionidae family to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships and historical scenarios. The team discovered that the genus Agehana actually falls within the American Papilio subgenus Pterourus and is not as previously suggested phylogenetically close to the Asian Papilio subgenus Chilasa, which explains the great morphological distinction of the Agehana from other Asian butterflies, the team said. The team inferred from the dating and biogeographic analysis that an American ancestor of Pterourus was distributed to East Asia in the early Miocene period via the Bering Land Bridge \u2014 which connected Asia and North America at various times during the Pleistocene ice ages \u2014 and developed into the Agehana genus, resulting in the present \u201cEast Asia-America\u201d disjunction distribution. The broad-tailed swallowtail butterfly is classified as an endangered species in Taiwan and listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list of threatened species, the bureau said. The butterfly only feeds on Sassafras randaiense, a vulnerable species of laura tree native to Taiwan that is sparsely distributed across the nation\u2019s Central Mountain Range, it said. The butterfly\u2019s scientific name \u201cmaraho\u201d was derived from the Atayal language, meaning \u201cchieftain\u201d or \u201cleader,\u201d suggesting the unparalleled status of the broad-tailed swallowtail among Taiwan\u2019s butterflies, the bureau said, adding that it has designated 55,991 hectares of forest in Hsinchu County\u2019s Wufeng Township (五峰) and Miaolin County\u2019s Taian Township (泰安) as the butterfly\u2019s conservation area.","source":"taiwan","title":"Iconic butterfly \u2018migrated\u2019 to Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/12/05/2003634077"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Legislation aimed at forcing the White House to quickly transfer two US Navy frigates to Taiwan was introduced into the US Congress on Wednesday. The bill would order US President Barack Obama to provide a detailed timeline for the transfer of the warships within 30 days of it becoming law. Sponsored by US Representative Brad Sherman and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, the bill has substantial support in the House of Representatives. It is part of a growing campaign by members of the US Congress to push Obama into approving new arms sales for Taiwan following more than four years of inaction. Well-placed Washington sources say that Obama will inform Congress of a new arms sales package \u2014 including the frigates \u2014 later this month. \u201cWe should ensure that the laws passed by Congress to provide Taiwan the military equipment it needs to help secure our shared security objectives are faithfully executed,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe United States should not delay in securing the safety of our democratic allies around the world.\u201d Royce said that it was time for the Obama administration to act. \u201cEnsuring the transfer of these frigates to Taiwan is critical to bolstering its defense and ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I led the House in passing naval vessel transfer legislation last year,\u201d Royce added. He said that Taiwan had been waiting for more than a year for the frigates. \u201cThis important bill will press the administration to make good on our commitment to strengthen the US-Taiwan partnership,\u201d Royce said. Among others actively supporting the bill are US Representative Eliot Engel, a ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and US Representative Matt Salmon, chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Last month, US Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain and US Senator Ben Cardin wrote directly to Obama about their concern that Taiwan was not being adequately armed, while China was rapidly expanding its military. \u201cWe are troubled that it has now been over four years \u2014 the longest period since the passage of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979 \u2014 since the administration has notified Congress of a new arms sale package,\u201d the letter read. In December last year, Obama signed the Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2013, allowing the sale of up to four US Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates to Taiwan. The ships approved for sale were the USS Taylor, USS Gary, USS Elrod and USS Carr. Taiwan has agreed to buy two of them \u2014 the Gary and the Taylor \u2014 and has been anxiously waiting for Obama to actually approve the transfer, which has still not happened. Many believe that Obama delayed the final go-ahead because he did not want to upset Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平), whose cooperation he needed at this week\u2019s climate summit in Paris. The ships are guided-missile frigates specially designed for anti-aircraft and anti-submarine duty. \u201cThe Chinese side is firmly opposed to arms sales by the US to Taiwan and this position is steadfast, clear and consistent,\u201d Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qin Gang (秦剛) has said.

More than 1,100 POWs were forced to work in a copper mine at Jinguashi enduring starvation, rampant disease and constant abuse from guards, according to the Taiwan POW Camps Memorial Society. Pett, an enlisted man in the British Army\u2019s 80th Anti-Tank Regiment, was captured during the Battle of Singapore and said he endured inhuman conditions while on a ship transporting him to Taiwan. \u201cI remember most of the brutality of the guards,\u201d Pett said, adding that he believes in commemorating fallen comrades at the site of the former camp, because honoring his friends is \u201cthe right thing to do, and no one else can do it, if not me.\u201d \u201cWe can forgive, but not forget,\u201d Richard Bartelot Jr said, adding that even though his father \u2014 former British Army captain Richard Bartelot, who also served in the 80th Anti-Tank \u2014 did not talk about his days at Kinkaseki, he believes his father forgave the wrongs of the past. Taiwan POW Camps Memorial Society director Michael Hurst said that more than 4,350 POWs were detained in camps in Japan-ruled Taiwan during the war, of whom more than 10 percent died in prison. The POWs were fed meager rations of rice, despite the intense physical labor they performed, and were routinely brutalized not only by Japanese soldiers, but also by Taiwanese troops, who were \u201cabused by the Japanese\u201d and \u201ctreated just better than the prisoners,\u201d Hurst said. In spite of the guards\u2019 brutality, Kinakseki POWs also remembered local Jinguashi residents, who often smuggled food to the prisoners, Hurst said, adding: \u201cTaiwanese [civilians] usually treated the prisoners with kindness.\u201d Pett said his three remembrance visits to Taiwan had helped old wounds heal. \u201cFor over 70 years I used to suffer flashbacks and nightmares about my treatment here, and I still do\u2026 but I can now also reflect on the good times here, which previously never existed. Now the word \u2018Taiwan\u2019 sends thoughts of: \u2018When can I go again?\u2019\u201d Pett said. \u201cWhat a marvelous place. What amazing people,\u201d he added.

The event was designed to showcase Taipei\u2019s artistic touch and creative industry. Of the NT$8.33 billion (US$253.56 million) former Taipei mayor Hau Lung-bin\u2019s (郝龍斌) administration budgeted for the event, the center alone won bids totaling more than NT$286.6 million, which account for 70 percent of the NT$410 million already expended, the councilors said in a joint statement. The center is set to obtain NT$103 million to organize promotional events out of an additional NT$295.3 million Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je\u2019s (柯文哲) administration has proposed to fund the event next year, which was contracted out by the Department of Cultural Affairs as a \u201cspecial project,\u201d they said. Hsu said the International Design Gala award ceremony, which is to be hosted next year by the center at the W Hotel in Taipei\u2019s Xinyi District (信義), is expected to cost the city NT$7.27 million. A budget proposal submitted by the department shows that the center has asked for NT$1.88 million to finance decorations for the event. Hsu questioned the need to host the ceremony at the W Hotel, as there are numerous other options available at significantly lower costs, including the Mandarin Oriental Taipei, at which the city government can use the banquet hall 20 times per year for free under an agreement with the hotel\u2019s management. The city government proposed to pay the center NT$1.07 million for a banquet\u2019s decorations, an event that is expected to cost a total of NT$2.07 million, Hsu said. She called on the department to reduce the number of forums and exhibitions and to focus more on boosting international publicity for Taiwanese artists. Hsu questioned whether the center\u2019s board members \u2014 half of which are government officials \u2014 have managed to give the center a competitive edge over competing firms, as it has won bids for government projects totaling NT$1.5 billion since 2011.

Speaking at a news conference in Taipei, KMT caucus whip Lai Shyh-bao (賴士葆) said that Ma has responded to the public\u2019s expectations by defending the nation\u2019s dignity, citing the Constitution in his explanation to Xi of his stance against Taiwanese independence and Taiwan and China being two separate entities in the international community. Lai also touted Ma broaching the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d with Xi when they met in Singapore. Lai said that requests to let Taiwan join the Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Trans-Asian Railway Network met with goodwill, as Xi had ordered Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) Director Zhang Zhijun (張志軍) to grant Taiwan the memberships \u201cby appropriate means.\u201d Referring to a three-point statement by Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) prior to the meeting, Lai said that Ma had fulfilled at least two requirements that Tsai had said would make his meeting with Xi a \u201chistoric\u201d one. Ma has lived up to Tsai\u2019s expectations of \u201ckeeping Taiwanese democracy and freedom intact\u201d and \u201censuring equality and Taiwan\u2019s dignity,\u201d Lai said, adding that the \u201c1992 consensus\u201d might however not have met Tsai\u2019s proposition that Ma not set any preconditions going into the meeting. KMT Legislator Alex Tsai (蔡正元) said that Ma has taken a \u201cremarkable first step\u201d toward resolving issues across the Taiwan Strait. Ma\u2019s use of the Constitution to dismiss the notion of Taiwanese independence has made him the first president to have a Chinese president acquiesce to the existence of the ROC and its Constitution, Alex Tsai said. This sends a clear message that so long as Taiwan abides by the Constitution, Beijing should not use Taiwanese independence as a pretext to elevate tensions between the two sides, he added. He said that when Ma told Xi that Taiwanese are concerned about missiles Beijing has targeting the nation, Xi assured him that they were not directed at Taiwan. \u201cThis is a promise that is open to our interpretations. We now have the right to interpret whether any of China\u2019s deployment of troops or missiles is hostile toward Taiwan. We can use it as a reference in future discussions and ask them to deliver on this promise,\u201d Alex Tsai said.

Meeting in Singapore on Saturday, China's President Xi Jinping told Taiwan's president they must not let proponents of Taiwan's independence split them, at the first get-together of leaders of the two sides since China's civil war ended in 1949. Ma Ying-jeou, president of self-ruled, democratic Taiwan, where anti-Beijing sentiment has been rising ahead of elections, called for mutual respect for each other's systems and said Taiwan people were concerned about mainland missiles pointing their way. Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has traditionally favored the island's independence, is the frontrunner to win the presidential polls, something Beijing is desperate to avoid happening. China views self-ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as a renegade province, to be bought under its control by force if necessary, and has warned that moves towards formal independence could stoke conflict. In a commentary, the Communist Party's official People's Daily said the two leaders sitting together showed a desire not to let the tragedy of history repeat itself nor to let the fruits of peaceful development be lost. Progress over the past seven years - referring to the rule of the China-friendly Ma - has been possible due to a joint political will to oppose Taiwan independence and accept there is one China, albeit it with different interpretations, the paper said. If this 'magic cudgel' did not exist, the boat of peace would encounter a fierce and frightening storm, or even flip over completely, it wrote. Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait must join together and resolutely oppose the Taiwan independence forces and their separatist activities, the newspaper added. China's Nationalists, also known as the Kuomintang (KMT), retreated to Taiwan after losing the civil war to the Communists, who are still in charge in Beijing. The Communists and Nationalists both agree there is one China but agree to disagree on the interpretation. While bilateral trade, investment and tourism have blossomed - particularly since Ma and his KMT took power in 2008 - there is deep suspicion on both sides and no progress has been made on any sort of political settlement.

They come ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Taiwan in which the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is favoured to win, something Beijing is desperate to avoid. The Nationalists, also known as the Kuomintang (KMT), retreated to Taiwan after losing the civil war to the Communists, who are still in charge in Beijing. China has never renounced the use of force to bring what it considers a breakaway province under its control.

I am here to promise to everyone, we must be doing our best to reach the goal that we set previously, making the Taiwan Strait more peaceful, making the two sides more cooperative, Ma told reporters before boarding his flight to Singapore. Ma, chatting to reporters on board, as Taiwan air force jets escorted his aircraft out of Taiwan air space, said he was neither too nervous nor too relaxed about the meeting. This is an important task. We need to do well at every stage, he said. No agreements are expected in what is seen as a highly symbolic get-together at a luxury hotel in Singapore, a largely ethnic Chinese city-state that has maintained good ties with both for decades. China's official Xinhua news agency said Xi and Ma would exchange views on promoting the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and discuss major issues in deepening cross-Strait cooperation and improving people's welfare. 'Historic juncture' But the handshake sure to take place comes as Xi hopes to cement his place among China's pantheon of great leaders and Ma, stepping down next year due to term limits, tries to shape his legacy marred by growing anti-Beijing feeling in Taiwan. At this historic juncture of a meeting between leaders from both sides of Taiwan Strait, we genuinely hope that both sides can show sincerity, demonstrate goodwill, meet each other half way and confront their difficulties, China's official People's Daily wrote on Saturday. While China is laudatory, concerns have been raised in Taiwan. (Ma) cannot sell out and sacrifice Taiwan's interests, said Chao Tien-lin, director of the department of China affairs of the DPP. He must meet the expectations of democracy and public opinion in Taiwan. This is what we care most about. Ma and Xi meet in the afternoon. Both sides will hold news conferences after a short closed-door meeting, followed by dinner before Ma flies back to Taiwan the same day. It will be of huge symbolic importance, but will not be a 'game-changer', as Taiwanese voters are wary of the mainland's rising influence over the island, Yoel Sano, head of political risk with BMI Research, said of the meeting. Ma will present Xi bottles of spirits made on two groups of islands just off the mainland that have been occupied by Taiwan forces since the end of the civil war. He will also present Xi with a ceramic sculpture of a Taiwan blue magpie perched on a leafy green branch as a gift for their first meeting, a bird unique to the island, Taiwan's presidential office said. Chinese state media said the leaders would eat their dinner at a round table, presumably to avoid the thorny protocol issue of who would sit at the head of it.","source":"toi","title":"Leaders of China, Taiwan to meet for first time in six decades","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/Leaders-of-China-Taiwan-to-meet-for-first-time-in-six-decades/articleshow/49697313.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"China Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"SINGAPORE: The leaders of Taiwan and China shook hands Saturday at a historic meeting marking the first top-level contact between the formerly bitter Cold War foes since they split amid civil war 66 years ago. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou came together on neutral ground in the Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore, walking toward each other in a hotel ballroom in front of a backdrop of yellow, a traditional color of Chinese emperors and flanked by palm trees. The two men smiled broadly as they shook hands for more than one minute, turning slightly to the each side to accommodate a host of photo journalists in the ballroom. In brief opening remarks in front of reporters before going into a closed-door meeting, Xi alluded to China's long-cherished goals of unification with Taiwan, saying ``We are one family'' and ``No force can pull us apart.'' Ma said, ``Both sides should respect each other's values and way of life.'' When they split in 1949, both sides aspired to absorb the other, and Communist Party-ruled China still demands that Taiwan eventually unify, while many citizens of democratic Taiwan increasingly prefer to simply maintain the separate status the island has carved out over six decades. Critics of Ma in Taiwan are wary that his meeting with Xi will pave the way for Beijing to assert control over the island. Each leader hopes to seal his legacy as one who helped bring decades of division and mistrust to a mutually acceptable end. But the meeting is more about the symbolism of coming together than about substance. Both sides have said no agreements will be signed or joint statements issued. Three decades of hostilities followed the 1949 split, occasionally bursting into warfare in the Taiwan Strait, including over the Matsu and Kinmen island group, making dialogue all-but impossible. Tensions eased after China shifted to endorsing the option of peaceful unification'' alongside military threats in 1979, although it wasn't until 1992 that representatives of the two governments met in Singapore to establish the groundwork for future talks. While subsequent talks achieved little, they began bearing fruit after Ma's election in 2008, resulting in 23 agreements on trade and technical matters.

Although it is a self-ruling democracy with a fierce sense of its own identity, Taiwan has never formally declared independence from Beijing, which sees it as a renegade province to be reunified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Overnight protesters tried to storm the heavily-guarded parliament building in Taipei carrying Taiwan independence banners, but were stopped by police, who said there were around 100 demonstrators. There were no arrests. Protesters also gathered at Taipei's Songshan airport where Ma gave a brief address to reporters before boarding his flight today morning. The demonstrators tried to burn images of the two leaders with slogans calling Xi Chinese dictator and Ma a traitor with 27 arrested after they tried to tried to push their way through a guarded side gate. They included student leader Chen Wei-ting a key figure in last year's Sunflower Movement which occupied parliament for almost a month over a controversial trade pact with China. Television footage showed Chen dragged into a police van while officers with riot shields scuffled with protesters. As a president who doesn't represent public opinion, Ma doesn't have the right to meet with the leader across the strait, one 35-year-old protester, also named Chen, told AFP. A TSU spokesman in Taipei said legislative candidate Hsiao Ya-tan was taken away by police from a hostel in Singapore in the early morning, along with two of her assistants.","source":"toi","title":"Protests in Taiwan as Ma leaves for meet with Xi","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Protests-in-Taiwan-as-Ma-leaves-for-meet-with-Xi/articleshow/49699788.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"The Green Party-Social Democratic Party Alliance (Green-SDP) yesterday accused President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) of violating the Criminal Code by arranging to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) tomorrow and called on the High Prosecutors\u2019 Office to bar Ma from leaving the nation while the charges are investigated. \u201cWe do not oppose a meeting between cross-strait leaders, but we are here today to fight for procedural justice,\u201d alliance legislative candidate Lee Yen-jong (李晏榕), an attorney, told a press conference outside the High Prosecutors\u2019 Office before the group submitted their charges.

However, his plan was undone by last year\u2019s Sunflower movement and allegations in August from then-Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) minister Wang Yu-chi (王郁琦) that deputy minister Chang Hsien-yao (張顯耀) was a Chinese spy; a case that was later dismissed by the courts. However, Ma pressed on. The Chinese-language newspaper the Liberty Times (the Taipei Times\u2019 sister paper) broke the news that Ma and Xi are to meet tomorrow in Singapore in an exclusive story published online late on Tuesday. The meeting is one that the international community will undoubtedly scrutinize. Since 2012, Ma has intended to achieve a historic breakthrough in Taiwan-China relations, and arranging a personal summit with the Chinese leader has become his greatest preoccupation. In early 2012, Ma sent then-vice president-elect Wu Den-yih (吳敦義) to the Boao Forum in China to test the waters. Beijing responded by raising the stakes. China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office Director Wang Yi (王毅) told Wu that the Ma administration must shore up \u201cmutual political trust\u201d before further dialogue. In March 2012, Ma sent former Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) chairman Wu Poh-hsiung (吳伯雄) to float the principle of \u201cone country, two areas\u201d (一國兩區) to then-Chinese president Hu Jintao (胡錦濤), which earned Beijing\u2019s plaudits for being a sound basis for political relations. In November 2012, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held its 18th National Congress, which inaugurated Xi as China\u2019s new head of state, and also resolved to call on the Ma administration to join with Beijing to \u201cmake reasonable and sensible accommodations in the cross-strait relationship\u201d that would navigate \u201cthe extraordinary circumstances\u201d of a disunited China. Wang said the meaning of the National Congress declaration was a renunciation of the \u201ctwo Chinas\u201d (兩個中國) as well as \u201cone China, one Taiwan\u201d (一中一台), which made it clear that the CCP message\u2019s intended recipient was the Ma administration. Therefore, Ma considered 2013 the crucial year to secure a summit with Xi. In April 2013, Ma abruptly declared that he would not promote \u201ctwo Chinas,\u201d \u201cone China, one Taiwan,\u201d or Taiwanese independence as his China policy, a statement believed to have been made in order to establish the so-called \u201cmutual political trust\u201d perceived by the other side of the Taiwan Strait. In June 2013, Ma sent Wu to see Xi, to deliver \u201cMa\u2019s seven points,\u201d which were a direct response to Beijing\u2019s demand that Taiwan recognize the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d and to renounce Taiwanese independence as the precondition and the foundation to political relations. The so-called \u201c1992 consensus,\u201d a term former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi (蘇起) said in 2006 that he had made up in 2000, refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the CCP that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means. Wu even responded to Beijing\u2019s \u201cone China framework\u201d (一中框架) with an identical phrase that substituted one character of the word \u201cframework\u201d with a synonym (一中架構). At the conclusion of the meeting, Xi lauded his dialogue with Wu as a \u201chighly significant\u201d one.","source":"taiwan","title":"MA-XI MEETING: Ma legacy might come at significant cost to Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/11/06/2003631820"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-06","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Taiwan Says Meeting With China's Xi Jinping to Further Normalise Cross-Strait Ties","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taiwan-says-meeting-with-chinas-xi-jinping-to-further-normalise-cross-strait-ties-1240390"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.904211","longtitude":"116.407395","location":"Beijing"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Beijing Using Historic Taiwan Meet as Decoy: Research","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/beijing-using-historic-taiwan-meet-as-decoy-research-1240476"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Taiwan-China Summit 'First Step to Normalisation': Ma Ying-jeou","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taiwan-china-summit-first-step-to-normalisation-ma-ying-jeou-1240426"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"US Says Unclear if Taiwan-China Meeting Will Influence Taiwan Elections","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-says-unclear-if-taiwan-china-meeting-will-influence-taiwan-elections-1240299"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"LABOR Dairy rules to change Employers in the dairy industry soon are to be able to hire foreign workers, a labor official said, citing a consensus reached at a regular policy meeting held on Oct. 19.

The meeting Saturday in Singapore between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Taiwanese counterpart Ma Ying-jeou could be China's last to press its case for closer economic and, ultimately political ties, before Taiwan elects a new president and legislature in January that could put the brakes on Ma's pro-China initiatives. For Ma's ruling Nationalists, who have been lagging at the polls, it could boost their credentials for driving progress in relations with China, but also carries the risk of appearing too close to Beijing, further damaging their chances with skeptical voters. Presidents of the two sides have not met since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost the Chinese civil war to Mao Zedong's Communists and the Nationalists rebased in Taiwan 160 kilometers (100 miles) away in 1949. The two sides have been separately ruled since then, with Taiwan evolving into a freewheeling democracy. China insists that the two sides eventually reunite, by force if necessary. Confirmation of the meeting from Chinese Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office came hours after the Taiwanese side announced the meeting earlier Wednesday. The two would be meeting in their capacity as ``leaders of the two sides'' of the Taiwan Strait, office director Zhang Zhijun was quoted as saying in a news release posted on the office's website. That appeared to afford them equal status, possibly an effort to blunt criticism from the pro-independence opposition in Taiwan who accuse Ma's Nationalist Party of pandering to China's ruling Communists. ``This is a pragmatic arrangement under the situation of the irresolution of cross-strait political differences on the basis of the one-China principle,'' Zhang said, a reference to Beijing's insistence that Taiwan and the mainland are part of a single Chinese nation. The two sides never talked formally until Ma, president since 2008, set aside old hostilities to allow lower-level official meetings. China and Taiwan have signed 23 deals covering mainly trade, transit and investment, binding Taiwan closer to its top trading partner and the world's second-largest economy. Taiwanese presidential spokesman Charles Chen said in a statement Wednesday that the two would exchange ideas about relations but not sign any deals. The choice of Singapore as venue was significant because the Southeast Asian city-state with an ethnic Chinese majority population has strong relations with both Taiwan and China and serves as neutral ground. Singapore hosted breakthrough talks between unofficial Taiwanese and Chinese negotiators in 1992 that established a formula whereby they acknowledge that there is only one China, of which Taiwan is a part, but differ on the exact interpretation. Although Beijing insists on the so-called ``1992 consensus'' as the basis for talks, Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party has refused to embrace it, calling it meaningless and unrepresentative of popular sentiment on the island. Ma is stepping down as president next year after his maximum two terms, and the DPP's candidate Tsai Ing-wen is considered the front-runner to replace him. A DPP victory could prompt a sweeping reassessment of its Taiwan polices by Beijing, which has hoped that economic inducements would lead to greater acceptance of eventual political unification. Ma's government has come under increasing criticism at home for cozying up to China, amid fears Beijing will eventually leverage economic relations to exert more power over the island. Such sentiments helped the DPP to a landslide victory a year ago in local elections, raising the possibility it might win not only the presidency but also a majority in legislative elections also being held Jan. 16. Given the chances of a Nationalist defeat, China is likely to proceed cautiously to avoid further alienating Taiwanese voters. Xi warned Taiwan in 2013 against putting off political differences from generation to generation. China has long advocated a Hong Kong-style one-country, two-system form of joint rule, in which Beijing controls Taiwan but the island of 23 million retains control of its political, legal and economic affairs. That approach has little currency in Taiwan, where most favor the current state of de-facto independence. The statement from Ma's spokesman said the two presidents will meet to ``solidify Taiwan-mainland relations and keep the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.'' ``To hold a meeting across the Taiwan Strait is the consistent goal of leaders on both sides,'' Ma's spokesman said in the statement. ``President Ma recently has repeated many times that `at the right time and on the right occasion and in the right capacity' he would not rule out a meeting.'' Taiwanese officials planned to hold a news conference about the Singapore meeting later Wednesday, and Ma planned to hold one on Thursday. In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. would welcome steps taken on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to try to reduce tensions and improve relations, but added, ``we'll have to see what actually comes out of the meeting.'' Ma is likely hoping for some reassurance from Xi over the use of force and closer economic ties that could help Nationalist Presidential candidate Eric Chu in the polls, said Hong Kong Chinese politics expert Willy Lam. Xi, for his part, likewise hopes a friendly, non-threatening meeting could give the Nationalists a boost, while showing a Chinese domestic audience that he could be the best bet in decades for achieving unification. ``This could be good for his reputation and a feather in his cap,'' said Lam. While the meeting is meant to showcase the Nationalist's adeptness at dealing with China, it carries significant risks for the party, said Sean King, senior vice president with the consultancy Park Strategies in New York and a frequent commentator on Asian affairs. ``This meeting will only hurt the Nationalists at home, as it will cause them to even more be seen as Beijing's preferred Taiwan party,'' King said. ``This could be the mainland's last chance to liaise with the Nationalist Party, while it's in power, for years to come.''","source":"toi","title":"Taiwan, Chinese presidents to meet for first time since 1949","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/Taiwan-Chinese-presidents-to-meet-for-first-time-since-1949/articleshow/49653533.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-04","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Andrew Hsia (夏立言) yesterday dismissed speculation that Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) presidential candidate Eric Chu\u2019s (朱立倫) campaign slogan of \u201cOne Taiwan\u201d is a reference to the state of cross-strait relations.

Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Lin Join-sane (林中森) said that despite the ideological divide between the two nations, the government\u2019s strategy is to shelve disputes and create a win-win situation. \u201cBoth sides should reinforce exchanges on issues they can cooperate over, while putting aside disputes where they disagree,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThis is why we need the initiative of \u2018one China, with different interpretations,\u2019\u201d he said. Lin\u2019s remarks were dismissed by Chuang as off-topic and wishful thinking. Chu\u2019s \u201cOne Taiwan\u201d slogan has been interpreted by some netizens as supporting the cross-strait status of \u201cone Taiwan, one China,\u201d while others regard it as a KMT attempt to capitalize on the name of Taiwan to solicit votes. Chu has said the slogan refers to a united Taiwanese society that brings all people together regardless of their wealth, social status or birthplace. Turning to the APEC leaders\u2019 summit, which is to be held in the Philippines on Nov. 18 and Nov. 19, Hsia said the council is pushing for a meeting between President Ma Ying-jeou\u2019s (馬英九) representative, former vice president Vincent Siew (蕭萬長), and Xi on one of the two days. If such a meeting occurs, the council suggests that the pair discuss issues such as the promotion of the proposed cross-strait agreement on trade in goods, Hsia said. Schedules for the next round of negotiations on the agreement have not yet been set, Hsia said, adding that while both sides are inclined to ink the treaty by the end of this year, it would not be signed prior to the APEC summit.","source":"taiwan","title":"\u2018One Taiwan\u2019 not about ties: minister","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/11/03/2003631582"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-03","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"World Vision Taiwan, a Christian relief and advocacy group, is calling on the public to donate NT$2,000 per month to help 982 needy children grow up in a more healthy environment.

About 60 percent of the parents or grandparents have an education of less than grade nine or middle high school, while some are illiterate. Many of the children live with a parent who is an alcoholic or addicted to gambling and unable to support the family financially, the group said.

In the wake of the emissions scandal, Germany\u2019s federal motor transport authority has ordered a compulsory recall of all affected Volkswagen cars in the country, starting from Jan. 1.

Pillsbury, a former US assistant undersecretary of defense for policy planning, was speaking at a forum titled \u201cBeijing\u2019s Strategy of Unification toward Taiwan and the US Response\u201d at the legislature in Taipei yesterday morning. The event was organized by Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Mark Chen (陳唐山), who served as foreign minister during former president Chen Shui-bian\u2019s (陳水扁) administration. It was attended by several Taiwanese academics and foreign affairs experts. Speaking in fluent Mandarin, Pillsbury said none of the US\u2019 high-ranking officials have openly revealed whether Taiwan is included in its \u201crebalancing\u201d toward Asia, but the policy is expected to continue regardless of who is the next US president. \u201cThat is why Taiwanese people, both in the political or academic industries, are urged to put forward tangible rather than vague suggestions regarding the US\u2019 Asia pivot and clearly express their nation\u2019s aspiration to be a part of it,\u201d Pillsbury said. To address its international and regional exclusion amid growing ties between the US and China, Pillsbury said there are several measures Taiwan can take to undermine Washington-Beijing relations. \u201cIt could change the name designation for Taiwan, issue a different passport, or scrap its current national flag that reminds most people of the Chinese Nationalist Party\u2019s party flag,\u201d Pillsbury said. \u201cHowever, these actions would inevitably been seen as crossing the red line by China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army ... and I personally do not think Taiwan has to go down that road.\u201d Alternatively, Pillsbury said Taipei can surrender to Beijing and announce itself a part of the so-called \u201cmotherland,\u201d but the move would most likely unnerve the US as it is the least favorable option among its citizens. That leaves the nation with one last option: That Taiwanese intelligentsia endeavor to work out a way to allow Taipei to be a helpful partner in Washington\u2019s rebalancing policy without aggravating the Chinese government, Pillsbury said. Pillsbury\u2019s remarks were dismissed by a male participant at the forum, who criticized the US\u2019 opposition of renaming Taiwan as an oppression of the nation. \u201cI did not say Taiwan cannot change its name, I am saying that the US policy of protecting Taiwan\u2019s security is not without limit. It does not mean Taiwan can do whatever it desires and we still have to protect it \u2026. The policy is not a blank check,\u201d Pillsbury said. Former minister of national defense Michael Tsai (蔡明憲) urged the US to permit Taiwan to participate in meetings and cooperative organizations related to its regional security, and respect the nation\u2019s public opinion and development. \u201cThe US should not facilitate its ties with China at the expense of Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and its people\u2019s interests,\u201d said Tsai, who also doubles as the director-general of the Taiwan Defense Policy and Strategy Research Institute.

Judicial officials said the prostitution ring allegedly contravened international laws against human trafficking, because an investigation revealed that some of the call girls flew to China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, the US and Australia to provide sexual services or as \u201cbusiness trip companions,\u201d mostly for businessmen and other wealthy clientele. Three women with alleged involvement were summoned for questioning at the Taipei District Prosecutors\u2019 Office on Tuesday night, including the female proprietor, Tai Chun-yi (戴君儀), model agency manager Chung Yi-tzu (鍾宜姿) and Johanne Liou (劉喬安), whose good looks led the local media to dub her the \u201cSunflower Queen\u201d during her participation in the Sunflower movement last year. After questioning, the three, who prosecutors suspected of violating the Human Trafficking Prevention Act (人口販運防制法), were released yesterday morning with bail set at NT$500,000 (US$15,297), NT$250,000 and NT$50,000 respectively. The prosecutors followed up by summoning a number of suspects and witnesses for questioning yesterday afternoon, who included a female model who starred as the lead and spokesperson in an advertising campaign for a computer game, and other models and starlets said to be working in the entertainment industry. Because some of the women said they were not working of their own free will and had been threatened, the investigation has proceeded based on the suspicion that Tai, Liou and others were engaged in cross-border human trafficking. Reports said US authorities informed Taiwan of the ring\u2019s existence through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). In response to media queries, AIT official Joseph Bookbinder said he would not comment on individual cases, but he did say that Taiwan and the US work together to fight crime. Officials at the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said that after a tip-off by US agencies, they monitored Tai\u2019s activities and financial transactions for the past six months, before concluding that Tai operated the ring in Taiwan, but with powerful backers and the real masterminds in China. Officials said Tai provided Taiwanese starlets, models and showgirls as \u201cbusiness trip companions\u201d for wealthy clientele from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and also for overseas Chinese living in US, Australia and other countries. It is reported the sex workers sometimes spent between three days and a week abroad, with their clients paying between NT$500,000 and NT$2 million, and would also usually pay for business-class airfare tickets, five-star hotel billets, restaurant dining and other expenses for the escorts during their trips.

Greenpeace reported last month that a Taiwanese fishing vessel, the Shuen De Ching No. 888, was illegally harvesting shark fins and throwing the bodies of the sharks into the sea near Papua New Guinea in the South Pacific. The European Commission issued a yellow card to Taiwan on Oct. 1, warning that it risked being identified as an uncooperative country in the fight against \u201cillegal, unreported and unregulated\u201d fishing. Greenpeace said the Fisheries Agency sent officials to check on the Shuen De Ching No. 888 following the ship\u2019s return to Taiwan and found that it had falsely recorded its catch, cut fins off sharks and thrown their bodies into the sea, and violated the ban on fishing for black sharks. However, the agency\u2019s count of the ship\u2019s catch was far short of Greenpeace\u2019s, indicating that it is not capable of plugging management loopholes, Greenpeace said. That raised doubts that the agency would be able to solve the yellow card problem within six months, Greenpeace said, and if Taiwan cannot make improvements within that time frame, the EU could impose trade sanctions on Taiwanese seafood. Based on its annual fish exports to the EU, Taiwan stands to lose about NT$520 million (US$15.91 million) a year, it said. Greenpeace oceans campaigner Yen Ning (顏寧) said the captain of the Taiwanese ship admitted that it transported a catch early last month, but an investigation by the Fisheries Agency had found nothing and it ended up saying only that the ship made an incorrect report. The agency fined the ship NT$150,000 and its catch was confiscated, a punishment Yen said was too lenient. Yen said that reform of Taiwan\u2019s deep-sea fishing system is urgent.

EDUCATION Parents eye US education Seventy-five percent of Taiwanese parents are considering sending their children abroad for their university education, with the US remaining the top destination, according to a survey conducted by HSBC. When given the choice of where they would be willing to send their children to study, 60 percent of respondents chose the US, while the UK and Germany each received the support of 38 percent, the survey found. The global survey conducted earlier this year in 16 nations interviewed 300 Taiwanese parents with at least one child younger than 23. Though Taiwanese respondents indicated that they would like to send their children abroad to study, cost could be a barrier. An international student in the US is expected to spend more than US$165,000 in total university tuition and living expenses over four years, HSBC said. In the UK, the cost is approximately US$120,000. By comparison, it is more economical to attend a Taiwanese university, which costs about US$44,000 over a four-year period, HSBC said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/28/2003631131"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Chinese growth is good for Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/10/27/2003631011"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-27","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Thanks to the perseverance of police in search of her roots, a woman who was born in Taiwan and adopted by a Finnish couple when she was a baby has found her biological father and has made plans to meet him in February in Taiwan.

Schmitt said that the US can reverse this dynamic by inviting Taiwan\u2019s military to participate in joint and multilateral exercises, by expanding the transfer of weapons and by allowing more frequent and substantive visits by Cabinet members. He also called for a more substantial role for Taiwan in international bodies and endorsing Taiwan\u2019s bid to become a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership once the trade pact is up and running. The commentary followed an article published by the AEI last week calling on the US to rethink its approach to Taiwan. \u201cImposing artificial restrictions on interactions with Taiwan, as much as they might please Beijing, do not contribute to stability in the Taiwan Strait,\u201d the article by AEI defense policy analyst Michael Mazza said. \u201cPreparing for the worst \u2014 by talking to, training with and operating alongside Taiwan\u2019s military \u2014 is the best way to ensure that the worst does not come about,\u201d Mazza said.

HEALTH Chickens to be culled About 20,000 free-range chickens at a farm in Changhua County\u2019s Dacheng Township (大城) are to be culled today after they tested positive for influenza A virus subtype H5N2, a highly pathogenic variant of avian influenza. It is the second confirmed case of bird flu at the farm this year, which resumed poultry farming in July after a mass culling and disinfection, Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Director-General Chang Su-san (張淑賢) said, adding that sentinel chickens were raised during the preoperative period to ensure that the virus was not active in the environment. Migrant birds might be a possible source of contagion, as the affected farm is located along the shore and it is migration season, Chang said.

In Tainan, 183 new cases were reported on Friday, which was 16 fewer than on the same day last week, the CDC said. Kaohsiung reported 173 new cases, 39 more than a week earlier. From the start of the outbreak up until Friday, the three worst-affected areas are Tainan, with 20,172 reported cases, Kaohsiung (4,274) and Pingtung County (100), CDC figures showed. Since May 1, there have been 106 confirmed fatalities in the nation from the disease, the CDC said. While 22,500 dengue patients have recovered, 44 are still being treated in intensive care units, CDC statistics showed. CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) predicted that numbers of reported cases of dengue fever in Kaohsiung would start to slow by the end of this month as the weather cools. ELECTIONS FTP calls for candidates The newly formed Free Taiwan Party (FTP), which advocates Taiwan independence, is inviting people who share its political ideals to join it and run for seats in next year\u2019s legislative elections. A new political party needs to nominate candidates in at least 10 of the 73 electoral districts in order to qualify to run for seats in the Legislative Yuan. The FTP is hoping that if it can qualify to run, it could win 5 percent of the votes and win one of 34 party-list seats, FTP Chairman Tsay Ting-kuei (蔡丁貴) said. Tsay said that by representing the FTP in the Jan. 16 elections, politicians interested in public office could build their reputation through increased public exposure. However, the FTP, as a new party, is concentrating more on the 2018 city and county council elections, he added.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/18/2003630351"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-18","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Pro-China party dumps president candidate in Taiwan","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/Pro-China-party-dumps-president-candidate-in-Taiwan/articleshow/49436620.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-18","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Taiwan still has a long way to go before it can gain entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, a senior US official said this week. \u201cThere is a lot more that can and should be done,\u201d US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs Daniel Russel said. \u201cMy message to Taiwan regarding TPP is this: Keep up the good work.\u201d Russel was answering questions at the Foreign Press Center in Washington after US President Barack Obama\u2019s summit with South Korean President Park Geun-hye.

An international team led by National Taiwan University forestry professor Chung Kuo-fang (鍾國芳) analyzed the chloroplast DNA sequences of 604 paper mulberry samples collected from East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Pacific islands, and found that a specific haplotype, cp-17, which originated in Taiwan, is predominant across the region. It is assumed that paper mulberry, a common East Asian tree used for making paper, was transported across the Pacific by Austronesian people, who used the tree to make bark cloth, Chung said. The team\u2019s analysis found that the genetic structure and evolutionary development of Oceanic paper mulberries are concurrent with the paper mulberries in southern Taiwan, which offers circumstantial support for the \u201cout of Taiwan\u201d theory of Austronesian expansion, Chung said. Paper mulberry is a dioecious species, meaning that the male and female reproductive organs are found on separate plants. Most Pacific paper mulberries are of a single sex, so they cannot reproduce naturally, but rely on humans for propagation, Chung said, adding that those conditions are critical to preserving the genetic structure of the tree. The study was the first to use the migration of \u201ccommensal species\u201d \u2014 non-native animals or plants that are instrumental to human survival and are introduced into a region \u2014 to support the \u201cout of Taiwan\u201d hypothesis, he said, adding that linguistic, archeological and genetic studies have produced important evidence that points to Taiwan as an Austronesian ancestral homeland. The \u201cout of Taiwan\u201d hypothesis is a mainstream model of Austronesian expansion, which assumes that a large-scale expansion began between 5000 BC and 2500 BC, when Austronesian-speaking peoples migrated from Taiwan to Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The research also provides insight into the dispersal of paper mulberry from southern China into northern Taiwan, as a large amount of mulberry pollen was discovered in sediments in Taipei that could be dated back to 5000 BC, about the same time pre-Austronesian-speaking peoples from southern China are believed to have migrated to Taiwan, Chung said. Stone beaters \u2014 that were used by Austronesian migrants to make bark cloth \u2014 found at archeological sites in northern Taiwan could also be dated back to about 5000 BC, suggesting that ancestral Austronesians migrated from southern China to northern Taiwan and planted the trees along the migration route, he said. The team spent seven years collecting and analyzing paper mulberry samples from Pacific islands and Southeast Asia, and the results were published in the academic journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences earlier this month.","source":"taiwan","title":"Tree distribution supports \u2018out of Taiwan\u2019 hypothesis","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/15/2003630122"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-15","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"SOCIETY New rule for response times A new rule requiring medical rescue teams to arrive at accidents at amusement and theme parks within four to six minutes will come into force on Nov. 15, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said yesterday.

Birds are accessible, interesting and somewhat mysterious,\u201d said the 29-year-old from the US, who set a world record on Sept. 16 for notching up the most birds spotted in a calendar year \u2014 which is known in the birding world as the \u201cBig Year\u201d challenge. For Strycker, the magic bird \u2014 No. 4,342 since Jan. 1, helping him break a record \u2014 was a Sri Lankan frogmouth, a greyish bird he spotted in the Thattekad Bird Sanctuary in India. However, Strycker \u2014 who is recording his journey in a blog called \u201cBirding Without Borders\u201d for the US-based National Audubon Society, a nonprofit environmental organization dedicated to bird conservation \u2014 is not satisfied with his tally. Aiming to observe at least 5,000 bird species in his Big Year challenge, the globetrotting birder is to visit Taiwan this week in a bid to add 100 new species to his count in four days. The task might sound daunting, but luckily Strycker is to be assisted by the Chinese Wild Bird Federation, Taiwan\u2019s most established birding society, and two of the nation\u2019s foremost birders. With the help of Wayne Hsu (許哲瑋), the federation\u2019s director of conservation and international affairs, and Hung Kuan-chieh (洪貫捷), a former director of the federation, Strycker said he is expecting to see a lot of birds. \u201cTaiwan is an important stop on my 2015 world Big Year effort to become the first human to see half of the world\u2019s bird species \u2014 about 5,000 \u2014 in a single year,\u201d Strycker said. However, to meet that goal a precise, but flexible plan is needed, Hsu said. \u201cThe focus will have to be the Dasyueshan National Forest Recreation Area,\u201d Hsu said, referring to Taiwan\u2019s birding paradise, where 26 of Taiwan\u2019s 27 endemic bird species can be observed. Although the objective is clear, the plan cannot be fixed and has to take numerous variables into consideration, including weather, traffic and, most of all, luck. For now, Strycker\u2019s whirlwind tour is to start with camping on Dasyueshan (大雪山) in Taichung County from tomorrow to Friday. That is to be followed on Saturday with a visit to the nearby Huisun National Forest Recreation Area in Nantou County for birds like the Taiwan blue magpie and the varied tit. Finally, after a trip on Sunday to southern parts of the nation to see Taiwan bulbuls and black-faced spoonbills, Strycker is to conclude his journey at about midnight and take an overnight flight to the Philippines for the next stop of his odyssey. The main focus of the trip is to observe as many bird species as possible, Strycker said, adding that it would still be nice to simply marvel at beautiful creatures that can only be found in Taiwan. \u201cI hope to get a glimpse of the rare and magnificent Mikado and Swinhoe\u2019s pheasants in their natural environment at Dasyueshan,\u201d Strycker said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any trip to Taiwan would be complete without a look at a Taiwan blue magpie \u2014 Taiwan\u2019s national bird, beautiful and awesome,\u201d he said.

The integration of community engagement for palliative care education and the encouragement of talking about death through the use of mainstream and social media has helped increase public awareness of palliative care in Taiwan, the EIU said. Taiwan is one of the first few nations in the world to introduce a hospice palliative care system. In 2000, it passed the Hospice and Palliative Care Act (安寧緩和醫療條例), which provides its citizens with the right to issue do-not- resuscitate instructions. Fang Chun-kai (方俊凱), a physician at Mackay Memorial Hospital who specializes in hospice and palliative care, said compared with five years ago, Taiwan has instituted changes, such as introducing psychologists to the palliative care system to provide mental care and support for patients. However, there is room for improvement when it comes to the allocation of human resources and the environments in hospitals and hospices, he said.

The EC said on Thursday that its decision to issue a \u201cyellow card\u201d to Taiwan is based on \u201cserious shortcomings in the fisheries legal framework, a system of sanctions that does not deter IUU fishing, and lack of effective monitoring, control and surveillance of the long-distance fleet, while Taiwan does not systematically comply with the obligations of regional fisheries management organizations.\u201d The EC said it proposed an action plan for Taiwan and has given the nation six months to resolve the identified issues. Should Taiwan fail to address them within six months, Taiwanese aquatic products might be banned in EU markets. Fisheries exports to the EU amount to 13 million euros (US$14.6 million) every year. In response, the Council of Agriculture\u2019s Fisheries Agency said that the EC\u2019s unilateral decision to yellow-flag Taiwan was beyond understanding, as Taiwan and the EU had held four high-level talks on combating IUU fishing since 2012, and the nation had amended the Fisheries Act (漁業法), installed electronic recording and reporting systems on fishing vessels, and monitored load and unload operations at ports, as well as trans-shipping in accordance with the international standards. Taiwan\u2019s designation as an uncooperative nation would not have an immediate impact on the fishing industry, as Taiwanese fisheries imports are still allowed in the EU, the agency said. Activist group Greenpeace boarded a Taiwanese tuna longliner \u2014 Shuen De Ching No. 888 \u2014 last month and reportedly found 75kg of shark fins on the vessel without the corresponding carcasses.

Stokes said it was important for the White House to act quickly and deliver to Taiwan a package of outstanding arms \u2014 including destroyers \u2014 that has already been approved. He said that US industry should be given a \u201cblanket\u201d marketing license to assist Taiwan in the development of diesel-electric submarines. At the same time, the US should help Taiwan to refurbish its existing submarines and provide program management services, Stokes added. Stokes and research fellow at the US non-profit Ian Easton called for changes to Washington\u2019s agreement with the nation that imposes severe restrictions on military and political visits. In particular, the US president should be able to have telephone calls with Taiwan\u2019s president, they said. However, Pillsbury said that this might be akin to the US husband in a 40-year marriage telling his wife, or China, he would not be home because he was spending the night with his old girlfriend, or Taiwan. He said the act would be \u201cself deterring\u201d because the \u201chusband\u201d would know there would be consequences. \u201cYou are not sure what it would be, but because you are breaking an implied commitment, the reaction could be quite strong,\u201d he said. Easton said Beijing had failed to improve the cross-strait relationship and that it was time for Taiwan to \u201cdouble down\u201d and pivot back to the US, \u201cits only true ally and friend.\u201d Asked what advice he would give to Taiwan\u2019s next president, Pillsbury said: \u201cThe new president should ask for a policy review of the relationship with the US \u2014 a detailed policy review.\u201d He said Taiwan should explore the possibility of expanding its relationship with the US and examine the terms of the current ties.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan-US ties review due: academics","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/02/2003629086"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-02","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"More than 110,000 people are expected to take part in this year\u2019s Taiwan Cycling Festival, which is to begin later this month.

Tourism Bureau Deputy Director-General Wayne Liu (劉喜臨) said that Taiwan is one of the few countries in the world to experience positive growth from the Japanese tourist market last year, despite the devaluation of the Japanese yen. Approximately 1.63 million Japanese travelers visited Taiwan last year, but the number shrunk by 4.4 percent in the first eight months of this year.

The commercial\u2019s director, famed Hong Kong film director John Woo (吳宇森), weaves together time and space in Japan and Taiwan, the bureau said, adding that the commercial highlights Taiwanese food and events through a comparative montage. The commercial moves from Japan to Taiwan through flying white doves, a signature feature of Woo\u2019s work, the bureau said. The bureau said that the white doves reappear toward the end of the commercial. A headline in Japanese, which means \u201cOne\u2019s distance and heart are close to Taiwan,\u201d is displayed on the screen as the doves take flight. Kimura says \u201cTime for Taiwan,\u201d at the end of the commercial, the bureau said. The bureau said that the commercial was shown during the program Pet Kingdom on TV Asahi between 9:30am and 10am. The commercial was simultaneously aired on television walls at the Shibuya Train Station intersection in Tokyo and television walls in Dotonbori in Osaka. Bureau representatives aired the commercial in Japan for about 30,000 women aged between 15 and 35 attending the Tokyo Girls Collection fashion show yesterday.

Republic of China is Taiwan\u2019s official name and is engraved on the cover of all Taiwanese passports above the national emblem, which is derived from the emblem of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT). Stickers promoted by the activists cover the \u201cRepublic of China\u201d with the \u201cRepublic of Taiwan\u201d as separate stickers are used to cover up the national emblem with images of national wildlife. \u201cThe Republic of China passport causes Taiwanese to experience humiliation internationally,\u201d said Free Taiwan Party Chairperson Tsay Ting-kuei (蔡丁貴), stating that the passport often led bearers to be confused with citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China, causing customs delays in countries which allow visa-free entry Taiwanese citizens. Party spokesperson Lin Yu-lun (林于倫) said they were rallying to protest the comments made by Minister of Foreign Affairs David Lin (林永樂) at the Legislative Yuan earlier this week, that using stickers to cover the \u201cRepublic of China\u201d on passports would be illegal. \u201cIf all you are doing is putting the demands you wish to express on the passport, that is not illegal in and of itself,\u201d Lin said, stating that rules only forbid altering the content of the passports, such as manipulating the content of the smart chips or altering passport numbers.

He said that according to the regulations the ministry would have the authority to cancel any passport that bears the stickers, as well as extending the review process for passport renewal for people carrying passports with the stickers. He added that people who put stickers on their passports risked customs problems, displaying an e-mail from the American Institute in Taiwan\u2019s (AIT) director of consular affairs, which stated that if stickers were placed over the name \u201cRepublic of China,\u201d US border officials would \u201creserve the right to seize the altered document and refuse the traveler\u2019s entry.\u201d","source":"taiwan","title":"Group calls for \u2018Republic of Taiwan\u2019 passport stickers","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/09/26/2003628633"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-26","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Taiwan is unlikely to be high on Xi\u2019s agenda","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/09/25/2003628519"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-25","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"24.2225023","longtitude":"120.6545022","location":"China"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"China\u2019s expressed anger on Friday about a visit next month to Japan by Taiwan opposition leader and presidential frontrunner Tsai Ing-wen, saying Japan should not give anyone a platform to promote Taiwan independence views.

Obama should urge Xi to be \u201ccautious\u201d and avoid making a \u201csensitive issue worse\u201d in China\u2019s response to a possible Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) victory in the January elections, said Bush, who is now director for East Asia policy studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. There was a \u201cgood chance\u201d that the DPP would come back to power, he said in a post on the Brookings Web site titled \u201cThe return of the Taiwan issue to US-China relations.\u201d Xi\u2019s message to Obama was likely to be: \u201cYou Americans don\u2019t realize the danger that the DPP and its presidential candidate, Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), pose. You need to do your part to contain what will become a bad situation,\u201d Bush wrote.

She says she wants to preserve the current \u2018status quo,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut Beijing isn\u2019t buying the vagueness. Xi himself has warned publicly that the cornerstone of cross-strait ties would be shaken if Taiwan does not accept the political foundation of cross-strait relations, particularly the principle of \u2018one China.\u2019\u201d The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) is \u201closing its moxie,\u201d he said. If Tsai wins the presidency, but does not accommodate Beijing\u2019s demands, Beijing might take steps to restrict governmental and semi-governmental cross-strait interaction and use diplomatic pressure to reduce Taiwan\u2019s international space, he said. Bush speculated that Tsai could be pressured to respond, resulting in a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d and both sides might seek US support. Bush said Obama should respond to Xi\u2019s warning about Tsai by reminding him that domestic factors are likely to be more important than external ones in deciding Taiwan\u2019s presidential election. Obama should encourage Xi to give Tsai credit when she does not say things that challenge China\u2019s interests, Bush said, adding that Xi should create more common ground between the two sides, reduce misunderstandings and explore how to manage differences. \u201cThis is best done via private, authoritative discussions,\u201d he wrote. Xi should focus on what Tsai says \u2014 if elected \u2014 in her inaugural address and what she does after she becomes president. \u201cBeijing\u2019s interests are best served not by backing itself into a corner but by keeping options open,\u201d Bush wrote.

The War of Yi-Wei (乙未之役), referring to the name of the year in the Chinese lunar calendar, is the Chinese term for the five-month war in 1895 between Empire of Japan and anti-Japanese insurgents who rose up after the Republic of Formosa declared independence in response to Japan\u2019s annexation of the formerly insular Qing province. Academia Sinica\u2019s Institute of Taiwanese History director Hsieh Kuo-Hsing (謝國興), whose institute jointly organized the exhibition with the Academia Sinica\u2019s Digital Center, said the exhibition is named \u201cInverting 1895\u201d because it focuses on reversing nationalist historiography that focuses solely on resistance. The prevalent Han-Chinese nationalist perspective is simplistic and distorts historical fact, he said. \u201cIn order to give full justice to history\u2019s complexity, the interpretation of the past must proceed from the original documents and texts, instead of textbooks,\u201d Hsieh said. Most of the island\u2019s inhabitants chose to accept Japanese rule in 1895 in order to survive, he said. \u201cThere are multiple strategies to achieving survival, and welcoming Japanese rule was a viable alternative to resistance,\u201d Hsieh said, adding that denouncing people for being \u201cobsequious\u201d to Japan or the Qing Dynasty is prejudicial and narrow-minded. Hsieh said there are other narratives the exhibition aims to subvert. For example, he called the Republic of Formosa\u2019s founding \u201ca pretext\u201d that has little to do with Taiwanese independence, but a \u201cstratagem to thrust the Japanese annexation of Taiwan onto the international stage.\u201d Hsieh said the strategy backfired because no nation expressed interest in an intervention, and Formosa Republic officials, including its president Tang Ching-sung (唐景崧), fled. \u201cThe only people who resisted Japan courageously were ordinary citizens. All of the officials had turned tails,\u201d he said. After the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan included in the Treaty of Shimonoseki articles that, in addition to annexing Taiwan, gave its inhabitants two years to decide whether to sell their property and leave or to remain in Taiwan under Japanese rule, Hsieh said. About 6,000 people emigrated, or only about one person in 1,000 in relation to the pre-war population, Hsieh said. \u201cHistorians of Taiwan by consensus consider \u2018Japanese rule\u2019 (日治) to be better as a term of periodization because it reflects the epoch\u2019s historical reality and is more neutral, while \u2018Japanese occupation\u2019 (日據) is far less supported by evidence, since Japanese rule was not based on a forceful military occupation,\u201d Hsieh said. After the end of the war, inhabitants of Taiwan received internal passports that identified them as \u201cnew subjects\u201d (新臣民), while Japanese citizens were identified as \u201ccivilians\u201d (平民), he said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Exhibition examines Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/09/21/2003628229"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-21","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"TAIPEI: Rescuers are searching for four missing fishermen after a Taiwanese boat collided with a huge cargo ship and capsized off the island's north coast, killing five, officials said on Monday.

But do not depend on it if [the potential partner is] a communist autocracy and [you are] a democracy,\u201d he added. Another argument that calls for cooperation with China in order to resolve regional and global problems \u201chas been largely illusory when you search for concrete positive outcomes from a US perspective\u201d due to China\u2019s size, power and status as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Stanton said. The economic argument, which expects increased trade with China and states that continuing improvement in the Chinese economy would facilitate political change, has started to be called into question, he said. The assumption that the US economy has benefited from trade with China has also been rebuffed by studies, he added. \u201cAnother US policy error from the start was ignoring Taiwan\u2019s interests and underestimating its potential,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Washington policymakers in 1972 had foreseen [Taiwan\u2019s evolution into a vibrant democracy and robust economy], perhaps they would not have written off Taiwan so easily, just as no one would have ever thought of abandoning Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cA lack of knowledge about and understanding of Taiwan continues. Some of our key policymakers on China under the Obama administration have never even visited Taiwan, or visited it rarely, meeting with junior officials and academics,\u201d Stanton said.

An example was the omission of any references to Taiwan in describing the US policy of a reorientation to Asia,\u201d Stanton said.

Peng Hao (彭浩) and Yang Chia-ming (楊嘉明) won the title after beating competitors from Germany, Norway and South Korea. The competition is held every three years by iba, the world\u2019s leading trade fair for bakery, confectionery and snacks. The theme of this year\u2019s competition was \u201cCircus.\u201d The participants were required to produce a decorative piece from sugar, chocolate, marzipan and nougat \u2014 or a combination of these ingredients \u2014 three different petits fours, three different pralines, two figurines and a national specialty in which a cake is integrated. URBAN RENEWAL \u2018Taipei vision hall\u2019 planned The old Taipei city council building is to be demolished and rebuilt as a \u201cTaipei vision hall,\u201d the city government said yesterday. The demolition is to begin on Nov. 24 and to be completed on Feb. 9, Taipei Deputy Mayor Charles Lin (林欽榮) said. The building, which covers more than 13,000 ping (42,965m2) at the intersection of Zhongshan S Road and Zhongxiao W Road, was built in 1970. It was used as the office of the Taipei City Police Department\u2019s Zhongzheng First Precinct after the city council moved to its new building on Renai Road in 1990. The building has lain idle since the Zhongzheng First Precinct moved out in 2007 and it was declared abandoned in 2009. Lin said the city government is planning to reserve about 5,000 ping of the space for conversion into a \u201cTaipei vision hall\u201d that is to be used to showcase the history of the city council. Another 2,000 ping is to be used as the headquarters of various non-government organizations. PUBLIC SAFETY Nuclear safety drill planned The Atomic Energy Council is to hold the nation\u2019s largest nuclear safety drill in areas surrounding Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant in New Taipei City\u2019s Shihmen District (石門) on Monday. The three-day compounded nuclear disaster drill is to see about 6,000 personnel, including civilians and armed forces, take part in the evacuation and disaster management program that covers areas within a 8km radius from the power plant. The scenario of the drill is to be based on the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant crisis in 2011 by simulating a power outage and shortage of water supply during a nuclear disaster. Residents are to seek shelter at schools and gymnasiums, while patients are to be transported to Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Radioactivity tests are also to be conducted on local produce and water sources.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/09/19/2003628091"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-19","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Nine missing in boat collision off Taiwan","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Nine-missing-in-boat-collision-off-Taiwan/articleshow/49020659.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-19","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"9 Missing in Boat Collision off Taiwan","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nine-missing-in-boat-collision-off-taiwan-1218985"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-18","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Taiwan and South Korea have revised their aviation agreement in a bid to increase air travel between the two sides, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said yesterday.

Washington should place \u201cgreat importance\u201d on getting its Taiwan policy right, former member of the US National Security Council Michael Green said. Now a senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Green said the US needs to \u201cthink hard\u201d about the presidential election next year, \u201cnot so much for the outcome, but for what the next president should focus on.\u201d He said that the US has a core interest in Taiwan\u2019s success as a democracy \u2014 \u201cthe ability of the people of Taiwan to advance their democratic process without coercion and intimidation from Beijing.\u201d Green said that another core interest centered on Taiwan\u2019s place \u201cright in the middle\u201d of the First Island Chain. \u201cOne of the most problematic manifestations of Beijing\u2019s power is what is happening in the maritime security domain and the degree to which Beijing has demonstrated a readiness and a capacity to use military, economic and diplomatic informational tools to intimidate claimants to territories and waters in the First and Second Island chains,\u201d he said. The US used to think of Taiwan in the context of cross-strait security, but the nature of the problem has changed, he said. \u201cIncreasingly you have to think about the security of the whole First Island Chain, that stretches from Japan through the Taiwan Strait and Philippines,\u201d he told the CSIS conference on \u201cTaiwan\u2019s 2016 Elections and the US.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s defensive abilities matter, and should matter more in this broader context, Green said. He said that a third core interest was the economic integrity and growth of Taiwan. It counted on a robust cross-strait relationship and the integration of the economy into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, Green said. \u201cI do not think the next president of the US is going to change the core canonical interests on China policy or on the \u2018status quo,\u2019\u201d he said. Green said there were three things the next president should not do in dealing with the US. First, no surprises. \u201cThat means constant dialogue,\u201d he said. Second, no changes in the \u201cstatus quo,\u201d and third, no free-riding, Green said. He said that to promote a more robust trust and understanding, all presidential candidates should think about the defense budget, \u201cwhich has never come close enough\u201d to the 3 percent promised by the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). He said that the \u201cbeef market and other matters\u201d had become a shackle around Taiwan\u2019s ankles and should be settled to pave the way for entry into the TPP. Green also had three recommendations for the White House. First, no taking sides in the election campaign. Second, no pressuring candidates to take positions that are not politically realistic. \u201cI do not think the US government should pressure [DPP presidential candidate] Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to accept the [so-called] \u20181992 consensus,\u2019\u201d he said. And third, there should be no violation of the \u201csix assurances\u201d in talking about Taiwan\u2019s election with Beijing. \u201cNo promises to Beijing that are not entirely consistent with our policy and the six assurances,\u201d he said.

The issue of US pork would not be included on the agenda, but Taipei and Washington have continued to communicate with each other on the issue, albeit on a small scale, Deng added. Taiwan maintains a ban on imports of US pork that contain traces of ractopamine, a banned leanness-enhancing drug. It is understood that the US wants to place the issue of access of its agricultural products to Taiwan as a top priority on the agenda, while Taiwan wants to discuss issues related to its bid to join the US-proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the inking of a bilateral investment agreement. Taiwan previously prohibited imports of beef containing ractopamine, but lifted the ban in July 2012, setting the stage for the resumption of TIFA talks in March 2013. The talks, originally set to take place in April this year, were delayed because the US was focusing its trade negotiation efforts on finalizing TPP negotiations. Taiwan needs to join the TPP, Deng said, adding that if a trade in goods agreement with China could be passed, it would help the nation\u2019s bid to join the partnership.

Chang said that Xi had been \u201cdiscredited\u201d by China\u2019s recent economic crisis and that he needed a \u201cbig win\u201d in Washington to regain face and restore his leadership authority at home. \u201cFor this reason, he is going to press US President Barack Obama hard on the Taiwan issue,\u201d Chang said. \u201cHe will pressure Obama to terminate arms sales to Taiwan.\u201d According to Chang, Xi will also ask Obama to work with China to keep the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) in power, to stop any moves toward independence and force Taiwan to accept China\u2019s cross-strait policies. A recent conference, \u201cXi Jinping in Washington: The Taiwan Factor,\u201d organized by the Hudson Institute, featured presentations by Hudson senior fellow Seth Cropsey and Project 2049 research fellow Ian Easton. Chang distributed a list of nine recommendations he is making to the White House. He said the Obama administration must abandon its policy of \u201cbenign neglect\u201d toward Taiwan and tell Xi that the US staunchly supports Taiwan\u2019s democracy and security. The US Congress, he said, should consider a resolution authorizing the US government to defend Taiwan and help the nation with advanced fighter jets, asymmetrical defense systems, such as submarines, and improved missile technology. Chang also said Washington should support Taiwan\u2019s entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and remove \u201coutdated\u201d restrictions and obstacles to cooperation. Cropsey said that Taiwan had been subjected to scores of \u201cmean-spirited and bullying efforts\u201d by China. \u201cXi needs to take something positive away from his state visit to Washington,\u201d Cropsey said. He said the US should help Taiwan \u201cin every possible way\u201d with the development of a modern submarine force and should ensure that Taiwan is part of TPP. Cropsey, who once served as US deputy undersecretary of the US Navy, said that Washington should declare its \u201cabsolute commitment\u201d to Taiwan\u2019s security and that Obama should declare publicly that Taiwan was strategically important for all of Asia. Easton said that as a result of China\u2019s moves in the South China Sea, the Pentagon was not thinking about Taiwan as much as it did 10 years ago, even though the threat to Taiwan had increased \u201cat a remarkable pace.\u201d He said that the main motivation behind China\u2019s military build-up was the possible invasion of Taiwan. Easton said that the quality of Taiwan\u2019s military was still sufficient to hold off an invasion, but this might not always be the case. Hudson senior fellow Michael Pillsbury, who chaired the event, said there was a need to remove many of the restrictions that are now placed on Taiwan-US relations, including rules that stop the president visiting Washington and limits on senior US government and military officials from visiting Taiwan. Closing the conference, Chang said that his greatest concern was that the Obama administration had not made up its mind if China was a friend or foe.","source":"taiwan","title":"Xi to focus on Taiwan during US visit: Parris Chang","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/09/10/2003627377"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Changing the face of farming in Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/09/08/2003627194"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-08","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"TransAsia Plane Lands in Taiwan With 1 Engine","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/transasia-plane-lands-in-taiwan-with-1-engine-1215401"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-08","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"LABOR AFFAIRS Ministry supports extension The Ministry of Labor supports a proposal by legislators to allow blue-collar workers to work in the nation for a longer period of time, Minister of Labor Chen I-min (陳益民) said.

However, the ministry is inclined to support an alternative proposal to allow foreign workers who have worked in Taiwan for 12 years and meet certain requirements to stay longer, without setting a maximum length for their employment, Chen said.

HEALTH CDC warns on enterovirus The public should pay attention to personal hygiene, as increasing interaction among students at the start of the new school year is likely to increase enterovirus transmissions, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warned. Enterovirus is highly contagious, especially in crowded areas such as households and childcare facilities, where cluster infections often occur, the centers said, adding that children under the age of five are at greatest risk of developing severe complications. The centers said the nation remains in the grip of an enterovirus outbreak, with 9,747 cases, 9,811 cases and 9,536 cases respectively reported in the past three weeks, which is close to the epidemic threshold of 9,696 cases per week. Medical attention should be sought immediately in cases where a child develops symptoms such as a persistent fever, drowsiness, lethargy or frequent vomiting, the centers said.

Initially, the focus will be on automotive, textile and information, communication and technology (ICT) sectors,\" said Chen. In 2011, the then chief minister Narendra Modi had announced that Taiwan will set up an industrial park in Sanand. The industrial park is likely to be spread over 700-800 acres in Sanand and Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) will develop it. \"In the next two to three years, you can see investments from Taiwan in Gujarat. In the last two years, we have had over 150 business meetings with various companies and government officials in Gujarat,\" added Chen. He also said that Taiwan is interested in setting up SEZs and industrial clusters in Gujarat. Chen also said that a 25-member delegation comprising Taiwanese companies from various sectors will be visiting Gujarat on October 5 this year. \"The members are still being finalized and it will be a horizontal delegation. Our aim is 'trade first before investment'. We will showcase Gujarat to the delegation.\" Taiwan's biggest steel maker China Steel Corporation (CSC) had signed an agreement with the Gujarat government in 2012 to set up an electrical steel plant on a 145-acre plot at Dahej at a cost of Rs 6,000-crore.

The plan calls for the ministry to send units from the Air Defense Missile Command to the US for operating, launching, flight surveillance, target interception and other tests of the PAC-3 system. Under the current planning, about 40 military personnel from the Air Defense Missile Command will go to the US White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico for training and to carry out the tests, a high-level defense ministry official said. They will be joined by top deputies and representatives from General Staff Headquarters to supervise and monitor the Patriot missiles launch operation and test-fire results, according to the official, who declined to be named. Japan was the first of the US\u2019 allied nations in the western Pacific to conduct PAC-3 flight tests at a US military base, and Taiwan is to be the second next year.

At first, the government spoke to Washington about test-firing the missiles at a Taiwanese military base, but the US side turned down the request, after declining a similar request by Japan, the official said.

At that time, Yen said the ministry decided not to spend the money and put the plan on the backburner due to constraints in the defense budget. \u201cThe PAC-3 currently is a vital air defense and anti-missile attack system relied upon by the US and several of its allies,\u201d the ministry official said. \u201cIt is a top-priority target for espionage and data-collection by Chinese military and intelligence agencies.\u201d \u201cIf the test-firing takes place in Taiwan, then China could gather the PAC-3 missile\u2019s electronic signal and other flight data. That would undermine Taiwan\u2019s national security, and could also endanger the air defense systems of Japan and the US,\u201d he said. PAC-3 missiles were included in Taiwan\u2019s October 2008 and January 2010 arms procurement notifications to the US Congress \u2014 330 in the former and 114 in the latter notification, for a total cost of about US$5.9 billion. The latest procurement came in January 2012, when Taiwan placed a US$921 million order for PAC-3 missiles as the military sought to bolster the nation\u2019s air defense systems.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan to test-fire PAC-3 missiles in US","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/09/04/2003626910"},"time":{"from":"2015-09-04","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Political commentator Cheng Hung-yi (鄭弘儀) on Monday criticized Fubon Braves head coach Yen Hsing-shu (顏行書) over a Facebook post.

The 14.3m-tall lighthouse was built by Japanese for the construction of a submarine cable between Taiwan and Japan, and also to serve as a navigation aid. In 1962, the tower was renovated into an octagonal building and painted black and white. To promote the lighthouse as a tourist destination in the Guanyinshan National Scenic Area, the Tourism Bureau has sought to add more recreational facilities in neighboring areas.

Half of those in favor of the delay believe that getting enough sleep would keep children in good spirits and help them perform better academically. However, about 10 percent of parents did not support delaying school start times, saying that it would encourage children to go to bed later. The survey was conducted online between July 28 and Aug. 7, involving 1,996 parents. According to a study conducted in 2010 by the Sleep Center at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, sixth-graders get an average of 8.7 hours of sleep on weekdays.

Transition (前進樂團) is one of the few Western bands to have achieved this impressive feat and more. Catapulted into stardom by its first Mandarin hit, Dui Bu Qi (對不起我的中文不好), the band has attracted more than 2.5 million views on its YouTube channel. More than 100,000 have also viewed a 30-minute online documentary about band members\u2019 lives in Taiwan. In December 2013, when the band\u2019s album Kua Yue (跨越) was released by Asia Muse in digital format, it stayed in the top five in the Indievox chart in Taiwan for four consecutive weeks. Transition has also performed on YouTube covers of classic Mandarin hits, such as Ni Zenme Shuo (你怎麼說) by Teresa Teng (鄧麗君), Red Bean (紅豆) by Faye Wong (王菲) and You Are My Flower (妳是我的花朵) by Wu Bai (伍佰). Composing their own hits in Mandarin was only made harder because they had to do it outside Taiwan. When applying for new work permits, band members discovered their applications had been blocked because they had performed at a church in 2010 and were given a monetary gift, an action that the government deemed illegal and merited a three-year ban from the country. The band hails from Bristol, England. In 2002, band members met some Taiwanese who were studying English in Bristol. Their new Taiwanese friends told them that their music would have an audience in Taiwan and encouraged them to search for opportunities to tour Taiwan. Friends also introduced them to Mandarin music through David Tao\u2019s album Black Tangerine (黑色柳丁), which fascinated them with its blend of Western rock and Eastern melodies and lyrics. In 2005, Transition took part in the Spring Scream outdoor music festival and immediately felt a sense of connection with Taiwan. Four years later, the group moved to Taiwan because \u201cfirst and foremost, it was friendship that made Taiwan feel so much like home,\u201d drummer Josh Edbrooke said. Moving to Taiwan was a huge learning experience and the band\u2019s members had to unlearn many of their Western habits to embrace the Taiwanese way of doing things. The leap to Mandarin was a particularly big challenge. \u201cSinging in Chinese was something that we always felt was out of reach for us. Particularly the idea of writing our own songs in Chinese seemed impossible. But through taking things one step at a time, we found ourselves creating a whole Mandarin album,\u201d Edbrooke said. His brother Jesse is responsible for guitar and vocals, and Niall Dunne, who was with the band for most of its run in Taiwan until 2013, also handled vocals and several instruments. Another member, Steve Dunne, left the band in 2007 before it settled in Taiwan. The first step was singing some simple Mandarin covers. After some time, they asked a friend to translate some of their English songs, which they performed. From there, they began to use the simple Mandarin they knew to write songs that reflected their life experience. In 2012, the band was commissioned to compose the official theme song for the Taiwanese team at the London Olympics. Having just completed a successful 21-city tour of China, the band is back in Britain putting the finishing touches on a new Mandarin album.","source":"taiwan","title":"UK rock band Transition finds connection in Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/08/27/2003626311"},"time":{"from":"2015-08-27","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"HEALTH MERS warning reiterated Travelers to the Middle East should be on the alert as the number of reported cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has been escalating in that region, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on Tuesday.

The double taxation avoidance agreement is the 29th of its kind to be signed by Taiwan and the 103th to be signed by China. According to the agreement, any businesses whose places of effective management are in Taiwan will be protected, including those that invest in China via a third territory. The agreement is based on the principle of non-retroactivity and non-applicability to criminal matters, which is aimed at protecting Taiwanese businesses that might face criminal prosecution for tax evasion in China. Ministry of Finance officials said that the agreement would not only reduce the tax burden on Taiwanese companies, but would also attract foreign companies to set up operations in Taiwan. The accord allows foreign companies that have set up subsidiaries in Taiwan to access the Chinese market directly, the officials said, adding that new foreign companies that meet the criteria are also covered by the agreement.

However, the Green Party Taiwan added that it still needs to hold hearings at its local chapters to communicate with party members before ranking its legislator-at-large list, which it plans to re-rank after factoring in candidates to be nominated by the SDP next month. Shouting slogans, the four candidates vowed to introduce a new opposition force to the legislature\u2019s bipartisan politics by tapping into their collective experience campaigning for environmental protection and labor rights, as well as the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights movement. Lee said that both the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) favor business conglomerates through the deregulation of environmental laws and the promotion of industries that pollute heavily and consume large amounts of energy. Lee said there are few lawmakers who speak up for the environment and minorities, adding a new opposition party in the legislature is urgently needed to stand firm on a sustainable and localized environmental and economic platform. Adding that a marriage equality bill has been mothballed by the legislature for almost two years since it passed its first reading in 2013, Hsu said that both the KMT and the DPP have sided with anti-LGBT camps in an attempt to win votes, paying little attention to gay rights. A progressive force other than the two major political parties is needed to fight for the rights of LGBT groups, Hsu said, adding that her policies would be structured according to the principles of gender equality and a sustainable and fair economy. Chang said the nation\u2019s economic gains have only benefited large businesses, and that both the KMT and DPP have been striving for economic growth, but have paradoxically contributed to deteriorating working conditions. Workers need to stand up against the oligarchy of major parties and businesses and unite with progressive powers to effect changes in the legislature, Chang said. A long-time environmental activist, Chan said that social movements and his personal involvement have contributed to the creation of several acts and enactment of legal reforms. He proposed that the alliance, should it win enough votes to gain a political party subsidy and legislative seats, divert one-third of the subsidy and one-third of its legislative assistants to social movements and empowerment programs.

Topping the list are the temples of Angkor in Cambodia, followed by the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and Machu Picchu in Peru.

The TIAP \u2014 formed by former Presidential Office advisers Peng Ming-min (彭明敏) and Wu Li-pei (吳澧培), former Presidential Office secretary-general Chen Shih-meng (陳師孟), Reverend Kao Chun-ming (高俊明) of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan and political commentator Chin Heng-wei (金恆煒) \u2014 announced the decision at a news conference in Taipei yesterday, aiming to help pan-green factions achieve a majority in the Legislative Yuan. The NPP is a new player on the scene, Chin said, and combining the older generation of pro-Taiwanese independence politicians with the \u201cnaturally independent\u201d new generation will bring about a change to Taiwan\u2019s future. The term \u201cnatural independence,\u201d or \u201cnaturally independent,\u201d was coined by former Democratic Progressive Party chairperson and veteran activist Lin I-hsiung (林義雄) in his book The Natural Independence of the Younger Generation (年輕世代的自然獨), in which he said that as opposed to the older generations who formed their ideas of independence after an intellectual struggle against the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) brainwashing they grew up with, the younger generation has grown up in a society in which Taiwanese independence is a mainstream ideal, which makes them \u201cnaturally independent.\u201d Combining forces in Taiwanese politics will ensure the continuation of the pro-Taiwan independence movement, Chin said, adding that he hopes the NPP will add the creation of a Taiwanese constitution to its charter and include \u201cTaiwan\u201d in the party\u2019s official name. Speaking on behalf of Peng and Wu, Taiwan Friends Association president Huang Kun-hu (黃崑虎) said that he was very excited when he heard the news and felt a renewed hope for Taiwan.

Given the construction could take at least two years, Taipower has estimated the spent fuel problem could cause a reduction in nuclear power generation, thereby causing a power supply shortage.

Heavy rain lashed China's southeast Fujian province, occasionally flooding roads with as much as two metres (six feet) of water, the official Xinhua news agency reported. But unlike Taiwan, no casualties or major damage was reported in mainland China. The National Meteorological Center predicted Soudelor -- named after a legendary Micronesian chief -- would be downgraded to a tropical depression by Sunday night as it moved further inland. At least 250,000 people were evacuated from the coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang ahead of the typhoon's arrival. The storm cut power to some parts of the eastern coast and damaged crops, state media reported. The typhoon ripped up trees and triggered landslides in Taiwan. Toppled trees and signboards damaged electricity lines, knocking out power to a record four million households. Almost half a million homes were still without power Sunday, Taiwan Power Co. said, as blocked roads hampered efforts to restore supplies in some areas. Taiwan's death toll rose to six after an eight-year-old girl who went missing Thursday after being swept out to sea with her mother and twin sister was found dead. Her mother and sister, caught in the strong waves on the east coast, were the first victims of the typhoon. Some 379 people were injured in the storm, which saw rivers break their banks under torrential rain and towering waves pound the island's coastline. Taiwan lifted its typhoon warning Sunday but the weather bureau warned of further heavy rains in the south.","source":"toi","title":"Typhoon weakens in China after killing six in Taiwan","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/Typhoon-weakens-in-China-after-killing-six-in-Taiwan/articleshow/48409964.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-08-09","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"4 Dead as Typhoon Soudelor Batters Taiwan","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/4-dead-as-typhoon-soudelor-batters-taiwan-1205119"},"time":{"from":"2015-08-08","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"In pics: Typhoon Soudelor hits Taiwan","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//articleshow/48400725.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-08-08","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Typhoon Soudelor hits Taiwan, millions without power, two dead","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Typhoon-Soudelor-hits-Taiwan-millions-without-power-two-dead/articleshow/48399931.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-08-08","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"TAIPEI/YILAN: A powerful typhoon battered Taiwan with strong wind and torrential rain on Saturday, cutting power to 2 million households and killing at least two people, media and officials said. Typhoon Soudelor made landfall early in the morning on the island's east-coast counties of Yilan and Hualien, bringing up to 1,000 mm (39 inches) of rain in mountainous northeastern areas and wind gusting up to 200 kph (124 mph). \"This is one of the worst typhoons I have ever seen,\" said a sewage station engineer surnamed Jiang, who was inspecting pumping stations early on Saturday. \"My car was shaking when I was driving. There are too many trees down, and I even saw six downed power poles.\" Authorities issued flood and mudslide alerts and flying debris killed at least two people, media reported. In the capital, Taipei, large steel sheets and rods were blown off a half-constructed stadium and city authorities shut down some bus and subway services. Hundreds of people were evacuated as the storm approached over the Pacific Ocean on Friday and the island's military put tens of thousands of troops and thousands of vehicles on stand-by for rescue operations. The Tropical Storm risk website said the typhoon was a category 2 storm on Saturday, on a scale of 1 to 5, and could weaken to a category 1, as it leaves Taiwan later in the day. Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau said the typhoon was still packing winds of about 100 kph (62 mph) close to its centre on Saturday. Soudelour has drawn comparisons with 2009's Typhoon Morakot, which cut a wide path of destruction over southern Taiwan, leaving about 700 people dead or missing and causing $3 billion worth of damage. Soudelour is expected to leave Taiwan at around mid-day on Saturday, crossing the Taiwan Strait and hitting the Chinese province of Fujian, where the government has begun evacuating people who live on the coast.

Human resource agency 1111 Job Bank yesterday said that according to a survey, up to 88 percent of working fathers are enormously stressed by job-related worries. 1111 Job Bank vice president Daniel Lee (李大華) said that a particular demographic that stands out is fathers born in the 1990s. Commonly paid well below the national average, these fathers tend to suffer the greatest financial pressure. According to the survey, the most prevalent sources of stress are \u201cfinancial burdens at home\u201d (76.3 percent), \u201cparenting problems\u201d (39.8 percent) and a \u201clack of pay raises\u201d (38.3 percent). The type of occupation matters greatly as well, with some fields inducing more stress than others. An analysis of the results showed that fathers in human services shoulder the most pressure in the workplace, closely followed by workers in department stores, medical services and agricultural services.

Written by Joseph Bosco, a former China desk officer at the US Department of Defense, the commentary was a response to an article by CSIS China experts Bonnie Glaser and Jacqueline Vitello published last month by the think tank. Bosco said that Glaser and Vitello sounded the alarm and warned that Beijing could react harshly if Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson and presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) wins next year\u2019s presidential election. He argued that the clock started running \u201con this particular scenario\u201d on Election Day 2012, since President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) by law could not run for a third term. \u201cWith no assurance of another [Chinese Nationalist Party] KMT victory in 2016, Beijing strived to make the most of the four years it could count on a Ma administration being more receptive than what might follow,\u201d Bosco said on the CSIS Web site. He said that Beijing bet heavily on economic integration as the path to forging significant and irreversible political bonds, but when Ma met strong domestic resistance, China changed tactics. \u201cPersuasion having failed to sway the Taiwanese to see things their way, China\u2019s Communist leaders reverted to their default position \u2014 coercion and threats,\u201d Bosco said. He said that unification is Beijing\u2019s ultimate objective, so the issue is not whether Tsai as president would do something rash and provoke a crisis. \u201cThat seems extremely unlikely given her calm, lawyerly, almost scholarly temperament \u2014 and her commitments to the United States,\u201d he said. Bosco said the problem for Beijing is what Tsai will not do \u2014 that is, accept unification against the clear will of the Taiwanese public. \u201cAnd that would be true of any DPP leader \u2014 as it was even true of the KMT\u2019s Ma,\u201d he said. Bosco said Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) and his colleagues need to accept that reality or \u201crisk losing more than Taiwan.\u201d \u201cThat is where Washington comes in,\u201d Bosco said. According to Bosco, the US faced a similar challenge in 2012 when Beijing made unmistakably clear its preference for Ma\u2019s reelection and Washington chose to put its thumb on the scale and throw unprecedented diplomatic support to the Ma administration. \u201cThis time Washington seems prepared to let democracy work its will on Taiwan,\u201d he said. Bosco said that Glaser and Vitello recommend that if Tsai wins as expected, the US should prod both sides to find a modus vivendi that ensures cross-strait communication channels remain open and pragmatic cooperation continues. \u201cThis is a worthy goal, though difficult considering the irreconcilability of China\u2019s and Taiwan\u2019s bottom lines on unification,\u201d Bosco said. However, he argued that it is not sufficient, and that Washington must pledge to defend Taiwan in the case of an attack. \u201cWashington needs to harden its position before Xi does,\u201d Bosco said. \u201cPeace in the region, even a tense peace, no longer allows the lethal luxury of strategic ambiguity, which only tempts China into dangerous adventurism,\u201d he said.","source":"taiwan","title":"US should \u2018openly\u2019 declare its intent to defend Taiwan from China: think tank","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/08/02/2003624465"},"time":{"from":"2015-08-02","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"DEFENSE Navy considering upgrades The navy is planning to upgrade its fleet of Sikorsky S-70C anti-submarine warfare helicopters in an effort to maintain the nation\u2019s self-defense capabilities, a military source confirmed yesterday.

Eisenhower. The pledge showed Taiwan\u2019s gratitude toward the former US president for his adamant support of the nation\u2019s security and economic development during the 1950s and 1960s. At a donation ceremony, Representative to the US Shen Lyu-shun (沈呂巡) said that without Eisenhower\u2019s support, China would have taken over Taiwan by force. Shen, who witnessed Eisenhower\u2019s visit to Taiwan in 1960, said that the US president stood in front of the Presidential Office Building and addressed the public to reiterate Washington\u2019s efforts in defending Taipei against Beijing. Shen said that during Eisenhower\u2019s visit to Taiwan, China bombed Kinmen for two days. Eisenhower was the 34th US president and served between 1953 and 1961. During his term as president, Eisenhower signed the Mutual Defense Treaty between the US and the Republic of China with former president Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石) in 1954 for cooperation against Beijing\u2019s ambitions to invade Taipei. In 1955, Eisenhower pushed for an initiative in the US Congress to pass the Formosa Resolution, which authorized the US president to defend Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. Shen said that during his eight-year presidency, Eisenhower provided Taiwan with US$1 billion in financial assistance, which laid down a sound foundation and paved the path for the nation to build a prosperous economy. Shen said the financial assistance was equivalent to about US$8 billion in current US dollar terms. In a letter to Kansas Senator Pat Roberts, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission\u2019s chairman, Shen said that Eisenhower \u201cholds a very special place in the hearts of the people of Taiwan.\u201d Roberts said at the donation ceremony that Eisenhower and Chiang jointly fought for peace during World War II, and the firm cooperation between the US and Taiwan at that time led the two nations to forge a closer partnership in security and enjoy the value of democracy in the 21st century. US Senate Committee on Appropriations chairman Thad Cochran, US senators Joe Manchin and Mike Lee, and US representatives Sanford Bishop and Kevin Brady attended the donation ceremony to express gratitude for Taiwan\u2019s pledge. The Eisenhower Memorial project has been in the planning stages for 15 years since the US Congress created the Eisenhower Memorial Commission. The US Congress has already appropriated US$60 million for design and planning, and US President Barack Obama\u2019s budget proposal next year is set to assign an additional US$68 million for construction. However, the US Congress has not yet approved any funding, with lawmakers citing complaints over the design. Since uncertainty surrounding the design in recent years has postponed fundraising for the project, the commission said it aims to raise US$20 million to US$25 million privately to supplement congressional funds, hoping to complete construction as soon as possible.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan donates to US memorial project","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/30/2003624234"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-30","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"HEALTH CDC lifts Seoul travel alert The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday lifted its travel warning for Seoul after the South Korean government earlier in the day declared an end to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak, which has killed 36 people.

Cambodia-based philanthropist Yang Wei-lin (楊蔚齡) founded the Field Relief Agency of Taiwan in 1995 and has since committed herself to helping provide emergency aid, food relief, student aid, vocational training, schools, micro-loans and the establishment of free crematoriums and morgues in Cambodia over the past 20 years. Based in Poipet on the Cambodia-Thailand border, the foundation is taking care of more than 100 orphans and has sponsored the vocational education of nearly 5,000 students, helping to build schools where more than 10,000 students have studied, Yang said. Villagers who are too poor to afford funeral services at public morgues usually cremate the bodies of their loved ones on rice paddies in the open, lacking privacy and \u201cexposing innocent children\u201d to the events, she said. Some villagers are so poor that they cannot buy enough firewood to build an efficient pyre, resulting in partially cremated bodies being exposed in the open, increasing the pain and suffering of bereaved families, who blame themselves for being unable to offer a proper funeral to bid a final farewell to the departed, she added. Rain washes the remains into rivers and drains, contaminating drinking water sources and increasing the risk of epidemic diseases, Yang said. To provide relief to villagers, and prevent farmland and rivers from being polluted, the foundation has established 109 crematoriums and morgues in rural areas in Cambodia, and has cremated more than 2,500 bodies over the past five years, giving the dead a respectful funeral service free of charge, she added. Each crematorium is inaugurated with a solemn Buddhist ritual, during which chanting monks perform a cleansing ceremony, while the foundation gives out rice to poor villagers, she said. At a floating village on Tonle Sap, the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, a 10-year-old boy watched the body of his father \u2014 drowned during a fishing trip \u2014 being placed against a tree by the lake with thin planks of wood and set ablaze. However, part of his body, fractured by the fire, broke off and fell into the lake, Yang said. The boy decided to become a monk and practice Buddhism after the heart-rending funeral, saying: \u201cI would recite scriptures and practice beneficence to prevent my father\u2019s soul from breaking apart.\u201d After learning that the foundation is building crematoriums in remote areas, the boy last year traveled more than 200km with his guru to visit Yang to request a crematorium in his village of Kbal Tao, she said. The crematorium was completed last month, with 3,000 villagers attending the ceremony. The guru passed away before the completion of the crematorium, but his wife expressed immense gratitude to Yang, she said. A crematorium costs about US$10,000, Yang said, adding that the foundation usually pays about two-thirds of the cost and that the remaining cost is shared by locals. The foundation\u2019s initiative has received financial support from many big-hearted donors, she said.

Chinese state channel CCTV broadcast a video clip earlier this month showing fully armed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army running towards a red building with a silhouette similar to that of Taiwan's Presidential Office. The footage has sparked a backlash from the island's media and politicians because of the similarities to the building in the heart of the capital Taipei. READ ALSO: China to drop entry permit requirement for Taiwan residents The military exercise was aired by the official China Central Television on July 5. It went mostly unnoticed until a Shanghai-based web daily published the event saying China \"would use force to solve the Taiwan issue\". \"Through the contact mechanism, we've lodged a solemn protest,\" Wu Mei-hung, spokeswoman for Taiwan's mainland affairs council, said on Friday. Chinese military created a look-alike structure of the Taiwanese presidential palace, and practiced storming it with air fire and armoured cars, according to Taiwanese sources. Taipei suspects China was preparing its forces for a future attack on its most important political structure. READ ALSO: China fumes after Taiwan's flag raising in Washington Reacting to the event, a spokesman for Taiwan's ministry of national defence said that the implied was \"unacceptable for the Taiwanese public and the international community\". \"The Chinese Communist Party hasn't given up on armed assault on Taiwan, and their military preparations are still geared toward the use of force against Taiwan,\" the spokesman major general David Lo told local media. The Chinese government denied that Taiwan was the object of the drill and described it as a \"routine military exercise\". This comes in the midst of presidential election scenario in Taiwan where the opposition Democratic Party is expected to win the mandate next January. The party has been campaigning for total independence from mainland China. President Ma Ying-jeou's engagement policies with China have proved divisive, compounding the declining public support his ruling Nationalist Party is experiencing over economic and social issues.

To prove his point, he provided a satellite image showing a building in the shape of a bisected rectangle, just like the Presidential Office Building in Taipei. Chang said elevated highway sections were constructed in another simulated area of Taipei for urban combat drills with the goal of paralyzing traffic in the capital by taking control of the highways.

Due to the gestation period of giant pandas, which ranges from 95 to 150 days, Yuan Yuan\u2019s unusual symptoms led to suspicions that she might be pregnant. Yuan Yuan has regained her appetite and her behavior appears to be normal, the zoo said. HEALTH Japanese encephalitis soars There have been 19 reported cases of Japanese encephalitis this year as of Saturday last week, exceeding the number of cases seen in both 2013 and last year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday. Four cases were confirmed from July 5 to Saturday in Taichung, and Nantou, Yunlin and Pingtung counties, bringing the total number of cases to the highest level since 2012, the agency said. There were 33 cases of Japanese encephalitis in 2010, 22 in 2011, 32 in 2012, 16 in 2013 and 18 last year, according to the CDC. The mosquito-borne disease is at its peak, so people should seek vaccinations and try to avoid mosquitoes, it said, adding that Japanese encephalitis activity is usually prevalent between May and October, peaking in June and July.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/16/2003623174"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) yesterday said that Taiwan would fulfill its pledge to help Haiti\u2019s development in its post-2010 earthquake reconstruction efforts.

He met with Haitian President Michel Joseph Martelly, telling him that Taiwan would never leave Haiti behind, but would help it move ahead and emerge from the devastation of the earthquake. Martelly said that reconstruction efforts have not proceeded smoothly, adding that more than five years after the magnitude 7 quake, just 10 percent of reconstruction has been completed. Taiwan is always devoted to global humanitarian efforts and has the responsibility to help Haiti, Ma said. It would continue to play a role in providing Haiti with relief during the long-term restructuring path, he added. The leaders discussed how to improve Taiwan\u2019s aid efforts. Ma has been considering whether Taiwan would be able to help Haiti develop solar energy generation, which would allow it to cut costs and spend the savings on reconstruction. The trip to Port-au-Prince is Ma\u2019s second state visit to Haiti. His first was in August 2013, when he and Martelly presided over a ceremony launching Taiwan-funded construction of a new Supreme Court building to replace one destroyed in the quake. On Tuesday, Ma attended the inauguration ceremony of the new court building. The Supreme Court project symbolized a strong friendship between Taiwan and Haiti and indicated that bilateral ties have become closer than ever, Ma said. Taiwan has funded roadbuilding projects, Martelly said, adding that Haiti is looking forward to Taiwan\u2019s help in agricultural development and boosting cultural exchanges. Ma said that the two nations would mark the 60th anniversary of their diplomatic ties next year and Taiwan is expected to devise more cooperation projects to commemorate the friendship.

Members of Eisenhower\u2019s family, including his two granddaughters, have objected to various designs submitted by famed Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry. However, the National Capital Planning Commission on Thursday last week gave final approval to one of Gehry\u2019s modified designs. While arguments surrounding the memorial have been complex and often waged behind closed doors, it seems that members of the Eisenhower family would prefer a traditional memorial similar to those designed to honor other former presidents.

However, as tensions between Beijing and Taipei grew, Eisenhower and the US Congress enacted the Formosa Resolution in January 1955. The legislation pledged that the US would defend Taiwan in the case of a communist invasion and resulted in a series of indirect negotiations between the US and China that ended a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. A 1.6-hectare site has been set aside for the memorial on Independence Avenue in southwest Washington, close to the National Mall and the US Capitol building. \u201cAs the memorial to this great man moves toward the final federal approvals required to begin construction, we are appreciative that donors are coming forth and expressing support,\u201d said Senator Pat Roberts, one of Kansas\u2019 two senators and the chairman of Eisenhower Memorial Commission.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan donates US$1m to Eisenhower memorial","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/16/2003623161"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"TOURISM Kimura concludes visit Japanese actor Takuya Kimura yesterday concluded a four-day visit after completing the shooting of a commercial by the Tourism Bureau at scenic spots in Taipei.

In a plea published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Shirley Kan said the president has \u201cfailed to exercise leadership\u201d by not selling much-needed weapons. Kan, who recently retired from the US Congressional Research Service, has written a personal analysis of Obama\u2019s policy on arms sales to Taiwan and says that the policy needs \u201ccredibility and clarity.\u201d Considered to be one of Washington\u2019s best-informed experts on US policy on Taiwan, Kan was not free to express her own views until now. \u201cUS leadership and credibility regarding the rebalance to Asia requires decisive, urgent action regarding Taiwan,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat policy should include tangible follow-up actions to support Taiwan, maintain stability in the Asia-Pacific and help Taiwan avoid coercion and conflict,\u201d Kan wrote. Obama has failed to notify the US Congress of major foreign military sales to Taiwan for almost four years. \u201cAs Congress will soon recess in August, the president has an imperative to submit arms sales for Congressional review,\u201d she wrote. She says that Obama\u2019s \u201cinaction\u201d cannot be explained by a lack of defensive requirements, by a lack of interest and funding in Taiwan or by military-to-military contacts with China. Kan said that leaves three other explanations: a shift in policy, a decision to wait until after a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) in September or that the administration is timing the arms sales to influence the presidential and legislative elections in Taiwan scheduled for January. \u201cTo dispel dangerous perceptions that the administration is at odds with US principles, policies and laws, Obama should now submit the pending notifications to Congress for major arms sales to Taiwan,\u201d she wrote. In particular, Kan is calling for Obama to notify Congress now that he is transferring two Perry-class frigates to Taiwan \u2014 an arms sale that has already been approved by Capitol Hill. Kan said that at the same time, the president should give \u201ca straight answer\u201d to Congress, industry and Taiwan on whether to assist Taiwan\u2019s diesel-electric submarine program. \u201cThis option involves the approval or denial of technical assistance for Taiwan\u2019s indigenous defense programs,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe president should finalize decisionmaking to determine if Taiwan needs new fighters to replace aging aircraft,\u201d Kan said. \u201cFinally, Obama should review policy with transparency, consultation with Congress and coordination with allies, examining whether a new approach is needed to accommodate changing circumstances in the Taiwan Strait.\u201d Kan said that the Congress has ways to ensure presidential compliance with the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).

Denmark supports Taiwan\u2019s entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), wants to expand the nation\u2019s international space and is in favor of boosting Taiwan\u2019s defensive strength. He had been serving as senior vice president of political and security affairs and external relations for the National Bureau of Asian Research (NBR). At the US Department of Defense, he is to replace US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia David Helvey, who has been less vocal on Taiwan issues. Before joining the NBR, Denmark served in the Pentagon as country director for China affairs. \u201cI can say wholeheartedly that Denmark has the skills and knowledge to be a key player in modernizing US alliances and partnerships in East Asia,\u201d former commander of US forces in the Pacific Admiral Dennis Blair said. In testimony before a US Senate subcommittee last year, Denmark said that Taiwan\u2019s \u201copen politics and its exuberant democracy\u201d were remarkable. He said that despite significant warming in relations between Taipei and Beijing, China continued to refuse to renounce the use of force to compel unification. Denmark said that entry into the TPP trade agreement would encourage Taipei to liberalize its economy and have \u201ctremendous benefits\u201d for the nation in the long term. He said that Washington should work with Taipei and Beijing, as well as other members of major institutions, to identify more opportunities for Taiwan to play a constructive role in organizations where issues of sovereignty do not apply. \u201cOn security issues, the US and Taiwan should continue to work closely with one another to enhance Taiwan\u2019s ability to defend itself,\u201d Denmark said. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s recent decision to pursue an indigenous submarine capability is a positive development, and American strategists and naval experts should work closely with their counterparts in Taiwan to identify the capabilities necessary to enhance Taiwan\u2019s self-defense.\u201d Denmark added that Taiwan\u2019s \u201cflat\u201d defense budget was a persistent problem and that it must be addressed. He also said that Taiwan should clarify whether its claims in the South China Sea are consistent with international law. The US had a \u201cprofound interest\u201d in enhancing Taiwan\u2019s ability to defend itself, he said. Earlier, Denmark and NBR project manager Tiffany Ma published an article online criticizing proposals from China and some US academics that the US stop selling arms to Taiwan. \u201cWashington has robust reasons to stand firm on its commitments to Taiwan,\u201d they said. The nation has continuing importance in a broad set of US interests in Asia and is a reliable friend, they added. \u201cBuckling to pressure from Beijing would not only lose Washington a valuable partner in its rebalancing efforts, but also heighten concerns among other US allies and friends of being sidelined for China, and even affirm a perception of US appeasement to Chinese demands,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe answer to the challenge of maintaining a positive relationship with Beijing is not to sacrifice a stalwart, democratic friend. Rather, both Washington and Beijing must find ways to cooperate on issues of mutual interest and when possible avoid competitive or confrontational issues within the context of America\u2019s ongoing relations with Taiwan.\u201d","source":"taiwan","title":"US promotes pro-Taiwan adviser","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/08/2003622541"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-08","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"SOCIETY Visiting teen dies in fall A Chinese-American, 17, fell to his death from an upper floor of the Chientan Overseas Youth Activity Center in Taipei, the China Youth Corps said yesterday. The teenager, whose name has not been released, arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday last week with his sister to participate in a 21-day summer camp run by the corps, China Youth Corps inspector Wang Chun-yuan (王群元) said. However, he appeared to have had some difficulty adapting and on Saturday last week began hiding in a clothes closet, Wang said. After communicating with his parents, the corps made arrangements to send the youth to Hong Kong today to meet with relatives, Wang said. It also arranged for him to visit the Taipei Zoo yesterday. However, after the zoo visit, his body was found yesterday afternoon in a garden, Wang said. Police said they are investigating the incident, including the possibility that the young man committed suicide, but said he had not left a note.

Chen, Liouciou Township Council member Hung Tzu-chien (洪慈綪) and a township council candidate were indicted on charges of paying NT$4,000 (US$128) per vote ahead of the Nov. 29 nine-in-one elections last year. Chen said he would appeal. A verdict in Hung\u2019s case is expected tomorrow. Hung, who ran for office for the first time last year, gained prominence while acting as a spokesperson for her family after her father, Hung Shih-cheng (洪石成), was killed when Philippine Coast Guard personnel strafed his fishing boat during a confrontation in May 2013.

The county\u2019s seniors and disabled residents will be better served, Wei said, adding that the county needs at least eight such vehicles to serve residents. He said that he hoped more people would assist the county government\u2019s efforts to help people in need. Chen, who grew up in the county\u2019s Erlin Township (二林), said he had always wanted to do something for areas lacking resources, especially when society is rapidly aging. The county government launched the mobile bathing program last year with two bathing vehicles, which as of the end of May had made 1,733 missions. The new vehicle is scheduled to enter service next month.

Having recently become members of the Taiwan Cyperus Association, the duo, both in their twenties, said they hope to bring cyperus weaving to the forefront of the nation\u2019s cultural and creative industry before introducing it to the world. Cheng, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in art, said that cyperus weaving is a \u201cliving craft.\u201d She said that cyperus, a kind of sedge, is inconsistent, with the thickness of each stalk varying, and that it takes an experienced weaver to fully master the skills of the craft. She said that it took her about two weeks to grasp basic weaving skills, but she still has a long way to go before she has a command of the advanced techniques. Cyperus weaving is a technique that requires practitioners to feel each stalk physically, a process she said cannot be conveyed verbally. Lee, a resident of Yuanli, said that he had chosen this line of work out of his passion for local cultural and community development. Inexperienced about art, he said that it took him a long time to familiarize himself with cyperus and that he had to work hard to complete his first project. He said elderly people in Yuanli excel at cyperus weaving, but have not passed on the technique. He said eventually he hopes to market woven cyperus products domestically and globally via the Internet. The association\u2019s Web site has images of woven cyperus products, so shoppers can get a feel of the diverse range of products that can be made from the material, he said. Association director Yeh Wen-hui (葉文輝) said he was deeply moved that Cheng and Lee were helping to revive interest in the the craft. He said that the technique was popular in Yuanli a century ago, but only a few people remain who are experts in the craft. The association is dedicated to developing, teaching and promoting the craft, and has also participated in international exhibitions, Yeh said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Pair intend to take craft unique to Taiwan global","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/07/2003622473"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Japanese doctors and nurses are offering to help their Taiwanese counterparts care for victims of the fatal flash fire that killed two people and left around 500 injured \u2014 including more than 200 in critical condition \u2014 at a water park June 27, Kuomintang ...","source":"japantimes","title":"Japanese doctors offer help treat hundreds of burn victims in Taiwan","url":"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/06/national/japanese-doctors-offer-help-in-treating-hundreds-of-burn-victims-in-taiwan/"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-06","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) reiterated that the name Taiwan uses to join the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is at the heart of whether the nation will participate in the financial institution or not. \u201cThe name used to join is very, very critical, and China knows that,\u201d Ma said in an interview on TV show CTS News Square aired on Friday. \u201cIf we cannot use \u2018Chinese Taipei\u2019 to join, then we would prefer not to participate,\u201d Ma said, referring to the name Taiwan used to join APEC in 1991. The AIIB charter says that members of the World Bank or Asian Development Bank (ADB) are eligible to join the AIIB, which leaves the door open to Taiwan, because it is a member of the ADB. The problem is that the Republic of China is not willing to use the name \u201cTaipei,China,\u201d which it uses at the ADB, Ma said. Taiwan cannot accept that name and has made its stance clear to Beijing, Ma said. Although the AIIB charter has been finalized, there is a process before the bank accepts applications for new members early next year, so the final phase of the process is likely to come then, he added. Also in the interview, the president said he has not ruled out visiting Itu Aba Island (Taiping Island, 太平島). With an area of 0.4km2, Taiping is the largest natural land mass in the Spratly Islands (Nansha Islands, 南沙群島), which lie about 1,600km southwest of Taiwan in the South China Sea. The South China Sea region, thought to be rich in oil deposits and marine biodiversity, is claimed either entirely or in part by Taiwan, China, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. Amid simmering tensions in the region, Ma proposed a South China Sea peace initiative in May, calling on all parties to put aside their differences and jointly develop the resources in the area.

The alliance said it would not rule out taking more drastic action if the move fails.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/01/2003622017"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-01","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Taiwan needs to act on climate law","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/06/30/2003621898"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-30","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"President Hung would run Taiwan into ground","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/06/29/2003621825"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-29","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Young Partygoer Dies After Taiwan Water Park Disaster","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/young-partygoer-dies-after-taiwan-water-park-disaster-776334"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-29","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Cigarettes or spark suspected in Taiwan fire that burned 500","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Cigarettes-or-spark-suspected-in-Taiwan-fire-that-burned-500/articleshow/47861577.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-29","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"EDITORIAL: Only Taiwanese can save Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/06/28/2003621738"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"Taiwan Water Park Fire"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"At Least 516 Injured in Taiwan Water Park Fire","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tally-of-injured-rises-to-516-in-taiwan-water-park-fire-776045"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"Taiwan Water Park"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"More Than 500 Injured in Explosion at Taiwan Water Park","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taiwan-water-park-blast-number-of-injured-rises-to-509-say-authorities-776010"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Taiwan Probes Water Park Fire as Toll of Injured Reaches 519","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tally-of-injured-reaches-519-as-taiwan-probes-water-park-fire-776122"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Witnesses Describe 'Hell' of Taiwan Water Park Blast","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/witnesses-describe-hell-of-taiwan-water-park-blast-776081"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"The government is on alert as tensions between China and Vietnam are again on the rise due to Beijing\u2019s unilateral decision to resume the installation of oil rigs in the South China Sea, officials said yesterday. Taiwanese businesses with investments in Vietnam are afraid of a repeat of the anti-China riots in May last year, officials said. Riots broke out when China moved the Haiyang Shiyou 981 near the Paracel Islands (Xisha Islands, 西沙群島) in May last year, which the Vietnamese government protested as a violation of Vietnamese territorial claims, while China said the move was legal as the islands were under its military control. Many Taiwanese businesses in Vietnam suffered break-ins and robberies, as well as arson due to anti-Chinese sentiment. Taiwan also claims sovereignty of the Paracel Islands in the dispute over maritime boundaries and territories in the South China Sea. According to a report on Huanqiu.com yesterday, which is owned by the Chinese Communist Party newspaper the People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Maritime Safety Administration announced on Thursday that from now until Aug. 20 it would be deploying oil rigs in the South China Sea. The announcement was accompanied by a demand for unrelated ships to maintain a distance of 2km from the oil rigs. The Haiyang Shiyou 981 is to be deployed to 17o 3.75 minutes north latitude and 109o 59.05 minutes east longitude, according to the administration\u2019s Web site on Thursday. Taiwanese officials said the location is southeast of the Chinese city of Sanya in Hainan Province and east of the Vietnamese city of Hue, adding that it was slightly northwest of the location that caused last year\u2019s riots. The officials said they expect the announcement to cause a strong reaction in Vietnam, and due to concerns for citizens abroad as well as the potential impacts to Taiwanese claims in the region, the government has ordered all foreign ministry officials to be on standby in the event of protests.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan on alert as tensions between China, Vietnam rise","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/06/28/2003621773"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"TRADE SHOWS Eight firms attend SAITEX Eight Taiwanese companies took part in the Southern African International Trade Exhibition (SAITEX) earlier this week in Johannesburg, South Africa.

The Jiuliao Primary School third-grader surnamed Cheng (鄭) was diagnosed with stage four kidney cancer. Cheng was born to a Taiwanese father and an Indonesian mother in Indonesia. She came to live with her grandparents in Pingtung three years ago. Cheng\u2019s parents work in Indonesia and her grandmother is ethnic Indonesian.

In terms of the area given over to mango cultivation and the volume produced, the municipality is the nation\u2019s most important, Lai said.

The UV reading across the nation could reach 8, the agency said. A UV index of 8 or above is considered high, while a reading of 11 or higher is considered dangerous. Yesterday\u2019s weather conditions were a result of a strong Pacific high pressure system above Taiwan, which sent temperatures to above 36°C in most regions, the Central Weather Bureau said. In addition, southeastern parts of the country have seen Foehn winds, warm and dry gusts that sent the mercury soaring to 36.9°C at 9:40am. According to the WHO, limited exposure to UV light is essential for vitamin D production in people, but overexposure may result in acute and chronic health problems. Dengue fever on the rise The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday urged the public to take precautions against dengue fever, after more cases of the mosquito-borne disease were reported. The nation has reported 149 indigenous dengue fever cases this year, about twice the number seen in the same period last year, the CDC said. From Tuesday last week to Monday, nine indigenous cases were confirmed, it said, adding that the outbreak could increase in summer months, which are favorable for vector breeding. The threat from abroad is increasing as well, with Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and Malaysia recording more cases this year, it said. Health officials said people should keep their homes free of standing water and take steps to avoid mosquito bites.

Some Washington-based China experts expect that Taiwan\u2019s upcoming presidential election, its likely outcome and impact, is to be raised by Xi. Following the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, both sides also praised the US visit earlier this month of China\u2019s Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, General Fan Changlong (范長龍). It is understood that during his visit, Fan discussed Taiwan and urged the US to follow the \u201cone China\u201d policy and not to encourage moves toward Taiwanese independence.

Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2014 was issued on Thursday \u2014 four months after a deadline set by the US Congress. There was widespread speculation that the delay was deliberate to avoid upsetting China before a series of strategic and diplomatic talks were completed this week and to appease Iran where nuclear talks are being finalized. In stark contrast to Taiwan\u2019s mostly clean bill of health, the report said that China was guilty of repression, coercion, corruption and persecution. The report accused China of using forced disappearance and strict house arrest, including house arrest of family members, to prevent public expression of independent opinions. It portrayed China\u2019s political system as ruthlessly repressive and one that regularly deployed extralegal measures to keep dissent in check. Turning to Taiwan, the report said that the judicial system suffered from some corruption, although efforts were being made to diminish political influence in the judiciary. The impartiality of judges and prosecutors involved in high-profile and politically sensitive cases had been publicly questioned, the report said. It also said that local media had reported incidents of police obstruction and violence directed at journalists who were covering protests against administration policies. \u201cLocal academics and media activists alleged that self-censorship continued, as some media chose to present news stories in favor of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) due to political considerations and the influence of local businesses with close ties to the PRC,\u201d the report said. \u201cSome legal scholars and politicians alleged that the Ministry of Justice was not sufficiently independent, claiming that ministry authorities conducted politically motivated investigations of politicians,\u201d it said. According to the report, female employees in Taiwan continued to be promoted less frequently, occupied fewer management positions and worked for lower pay than their male counterparts. The report also said foreign-born spouses were targets of discrimination both inside and outside the home. \u201cThere was reported discrimination, including employment discrimination, against people with HIV/AIDS and 60 percent of HIV carriers left their jobs due to coercion from their supervisors or workplace bullying,\u201d the report said. It said there was evidence of forced or compulsory labor amongst domestic service workers, farm workers, fishermen and in manufacturing and construction. \u201cNGOs reported that some labor brokers and employers regularly collected high fees or loan payments from foreign workers, using debts incurred in the source country as a tool for involuntary servitude,\u201d the report said.","source":"taiwan","title":"US rights report shows weaknesses in Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/06/27/2003621691"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-27","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"WEATHER Foehn winds forecast Afternoon thunderstorms could ease off across the nation today due to a strengthening Pacific high-pressure system, while the southeastern parts of the nation might experience Foehn winds \u2014 hot and dry gusts that can send temperatures soaring, the Central Weather Bureau said yesterday.

Ministry spokesman Major General David Lo (羅紹和) said that the victory belongs to the Republic of China (ROC) and said that this fact cannot be distorted. He urged veterans who fought in the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945) to keep the ROC in mind and not to be swayed by Beijing\u2019s unification propaganda, when asked about China\u2019s plan to invite former soldiers to participate in a military parade scheduled for Sept. 3 at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Chinese officials earlier yesterday announced that there would be a large-scale event at Tiananmen Square, including a grand military parade, to mark the 70th anniversary of \u201cthe Chinese people\u2019s victory\u201d over Japan in the war that ended in 1945. The parade is expected to be attended by some soldiers loyal to the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), they said. Luo called on people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to look squarely at the historical facts and learn the truth behind the war and the importance of peace. In 1937, the Chinese Communist Party and the KMT agreed to cooperate to defend China against a Japanese invasion, though that cooperation was often cursory at best, he said. The ROC government relocated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing to the Chinese communist forces in a civil war, he said. There will be a military display next month to mark the ROC\u2019s victory over Japan in the war, he added. The military held a rehearsal yesterday in preparation for the display, scheduled for July 4, at an army base in Hukou, Hsinchu County. Minister of National Defense Kao Kuang-chi (高廣圻), who presided over the rehearsal, said that the 70th anniversary of the war is a significant moment for the country and for the military, describing the war as the toughest fight in the history of all Chinese people. Kao added that China has not renounced its attempt to use force against Taiwan and the Taiwanese military must remain on guard, despite warming ties across the Taiwan Strait in recent years. Rigorous training is key to building combat readiness, he said. The military display is also a way to test the joint combat capabilities of the army, navy and air force, he said.

ANIMAL WELFARE Rights education urged The authorities are asking employers of foreign workers and recruitment agencies to step up animal rights education to help prevent incidents of cat or dog consumption, the Ministry of Labor\u2019s Workforce Development Agency said. A majority of foreign workers come from Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam, where it is legal to eat cats and dogs. Some of the workers are reported to have made meals using cat meat or dog meat. According to Taiwan\u2019s Animal Protection Act (動物保護法), anyone found to have caused the death of an animal banned from slaughter is subject to a maximum prison sentence of one year, in conjunction with a fine of between NT$100,000 and NT$1,000,000 (US$3,219 and US$32,194). The Workforce Development Agency said that many foreign workers are not aware of legislation regarding the protection of animals so it is asking local employers and recruitment agencies to help raise awareness.

The alliance is said to have resolved through its central committee to hold the event, with the aim to giving its full support to DPP presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) for the restoration of a Taiwan-centered administration, and to the legislative candidates of the DPP, the Taiwan Solidarity Union and other \u201cthird political forces\u201d to help them secure a majority in the legislature. According to the group\u2019s preliminary plan, the parades will take place in the six special municipalities, with the one in Taipei splitting into three major courses marching from Wanhua Train Station, Jhongxiao E Road and Daan Forest Park and converging finally on Ketagalan Boulevard. The Taipei parade is scheduled to feature live exchanges on screens with the parades taking place in New Taipei City, Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung, according to the plan, and the event might also be expanded further to include other cities. The Taiwan Nation Alliance, an alliance consisting of dozens of Taiwan-centered groups, was previously known as the Hand-in-Hand Taiwan Alliance. With Lee as the convener-in-chief it staged a Hand-in-Hand Rally on Feb. 28, 2004 that created momentum and helped former president Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) win re-election that year. The alliance has decided to invite Lee to again act as the chief convener of the event scheduled to take place in December. TNA chairman Wu Shu-min (吳樹民), secretary-general Wei Jui-ming (魏瑞明), executive member and former DPP chairman Yao Chia-wen (姚嘉文) and several other alliance members visited the former president on Monday. Lee, according to a source, said he considers Tsai to have even brighter prospects in next year\u2019s election after Deputy Legislative Speaker Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱) emerged as the presumptive Chinese Nationalist Party presidential nominee. Lee said he highly approves of the staging of the event in December, adding that the presidential election should not be the only focus of its endeavor, because winning a majority in the legislature is equally important. For that reason, any coordination has to be made with the DPP legislative candidates of respective electoral districts for the planning of the major parades to be held at the local level to mobilize and call out more participants, he said. Wei said that because Lee has now agreed to be the event\u2019s convener-in-chief, the alliance will soon visit Tsai to invite the DPP to co-host the rally.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan Nation Alliance aims to hold \u2018mega event\u2019","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/06/21/2003621219"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-21","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"24.2225023","longtitude":"120.6545022","location":"China"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"China backs a woman candidate as Taiwan prez","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/China-backs-a-woman-candidate-as-Taiwan-prez/articleshow/47742044.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-20","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"ENVIRONMENT Ecology volunteers sought A township office in Nantou County on Wednesday announced a plan to recruit volunteers to help carry out surveys and take care of trees in the township in the summer.

Tung Kuo-chang (董國璋), a veteran who received chemical warfare training, told reporters he remembers clearly the days of exchanging fire with Japanese troops in Bhamo, Myitkyina and Lashio as the Allies reoccupied northern Burma from 1944 to 1945.

As it turned out, 16 of the 17 zongzi sampled are safe; only one that is sold in Carrefour Taiwan contained more Escherichia coli than the allowable level. And 7 of the 22 zongzi leaves sampled were found to contain more sulfur dioxide than the legal limit of 0.03g/kg, including one from I-Mei and one from Hsin Tung Yang Food Co (新東陽). The department has ordered those food producers to immediately remove the food items from the market. I-Mei Food Co (義美) demanded that local health authorities re-examine the wrap of its zongzi after it had been found to contain more sulfur dioxide than allowed. The sulfur dioxide added in the zongzi leaves is meant to extend its preservation period and it can be decreased by soaking in warm water. People could vomit or have allergy after consuming too much sulfur dioxide.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/06/19/2003621076"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-19","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"WEATHER Taitung records year high Temperatures in Taitung County\u2019s Dawu Township (大武) rose to 38.7oC yesterday, the highest in the nation this year, according to the Central Weather Bureau.

The poll also found that 73 percent of respondents believe that rotating shifts are severely detrimental to their family and social lives. Only 5 percent think it does not pose any problem. Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Link director-general Cheng Ya-wen (鄭雅文) said working rotating and night shifts has been categorized by an international organization as a potentially carcinogenic occupational factor because it disrupts the normal wake-sleep cycle and can alter the endocrine system. \u201cPeople subjected to such work schedules are particularly prone to sleep disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

Why are you protesting against the adjustments? Students: Last year, we conducted a survey of all the textbooks ever used in Taiwan. The textbooks used in the Japanese colonial era put great emphasis on familiarizing students with Taiwan and students even had to climb Yushan as a graduation requirement. However, the textbooks used since the then-Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 have sought to make students memorize a slew of facts about Chinese history and geography, making students learn where the Yangtze River and Yellow River flow in China, without knowing where the Tsengwen River traverses Taiwan. That \u201cChina-centrism\u201d in the curriculum remains even to this day \u2014 when almost all students have grown up in Taiwan \u2014 with only a small proportion of the curriculum dedicated to Taiwanese studies, let alone giving the attention due to Aborigines and immigrants [to Taiwan]. A Taiwan-centric curriculum should be put at the center of educational reform, but the ministry is backtracking on reform by reinstating an anachronistic Chinese nationalist agenda at the expense of pluralism, which goes against the fundamental principles of education and which has provoked students\u2019 major dissatisfaction. LT: Is the National Tainan Girls\u2019 Senior High School pressured to select certain textbooks? Students: A high-school principal said that all students need to do is study and not to be involved in the anti-curriculum protests, which is typical of those educators with a conservative mindset. Our club members read out a declaration in opposition to the adjusted curriculum at a student council meeting, officially announcing that students at our school have joined forces with the anti-curriculum protesters. When asked to clarify its position on the curriculum issue, our school said that it \u201cdid not understand the issue\u201d and \u201crefused to be asked to reveal its stance\u201d on the issue. How could teachers and school administrators hedge at the issues of curriculum and textbook selection, which are a major part of high-school education? Is it not educators\u2019 duty to expound on their educational philosophy to students? Otherwise, how can students accept what they are taught? LT: How do you plan to protect your right to education in the future? Students: A teacher at a junior-high school in Tainan told a group of third-year students after a final examination last year: \u201cWhen you were struggling to write down correct answers for better grades, there were people organizing sit-in protests against the \u201cblack-box\u201d curriculum in front of the Ministry of Education headquarters. They are fighting for your right to education and I hope you can find out the problems and answers [of the curriculum] by yourselves.\u201d Some of those students entered our school this year and joined the opposition against the adjusted curriculum after studying the issues. In addition to starting an online campaign, we plan to set up more stalls on campus for students to write down their opinions and to make a video voicing those opinions as an alternative form of signature collection to petition against the curriculum adjustments. Hong Kong students initiated hunger strikes against China\u2019s \u201cbrainwashing\u201d national education and halted its implementation in 2012.

Hsu\u2019s mother said a schoolmate, surnamed Chiu (邱), deliberately pushed her son into oncoming traffic because he was jealous that Hsu had a 7-inch phablet. After hearing her son\u2019s account of the incident and watching video from the truck\u2019s data recorder, Hsu\u2019s mother went a Yingge police station to file charges.

According to the verdict, as Wang was leaving the post office, she tripped over a dog lying on the floor and fell onto an umbrella stand, resulting in a 2cm laceration on her jaw. During the first trial, a district court said the post office should be held responsible and should pay Wang NT$150,000 in compensation. The post office\u2019s defense was that the dog belonged to another customer and it had no control over the canine. Both sides appealed the ruling to the High Court. The High Court ruled for the plaintiff, and increased her compensation, including NT$20,000 for scar removal treatment. CROSS-STRAIT TIES Kinmen boss pushes ties Kinmen County Commissioner Chen Fu-hai (陳福海) yesterday said that he would spare no effort to help Kinmen become a pilot zone for trade and economic cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Chen made the pledge at a cross-strait forum in Xiamen, China, according to Xinhua news agency. Chen said that his county has played a key role in the development of cross-strait ties thanks to its geographic position. Problems facing Kinmen, such as water and electricity shortages, can be resolved only through cross-strait cooperation, he said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/06/15/2003620756"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-15","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Taiwan needs to prepare for threat","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/06/14/2003620641"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-14","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"24.2225023","longtitude":"120.6545022","location":"China"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"China to Drop Entry Permit Requirement for Taiwan Residents","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-to-drop-entry-permit-requirement-for-taiwan-residents-771457"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-14","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"24.2225023","longtitude":"120.6545022","location":"China"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"China to drop entry permit requirement for Taiwan residents","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/China-to-drop-entry-permit-requirement-for-Taiwan-residents/articleshow/47661554.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-14","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Taiwan trapped in economic cooperation","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/06/13/2003620566"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-13","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"WEATHER Taipei to see more hot days Temperatures in the Taipei area are forecast to rise to 35°C or higher at least 38 days this year, Weather Risk said on Thursday.

CRIME Ex-officer gets life for spying The Supreme Court yesterday upheld a life sentence for former air force captain Chiang Fu-chung (蔣福仲) for passing military secrets to China in violation of the Criminal Code of the Armed Forces (陸海空軍刑法). The court also ruled that Chiang\u2019s ill-gotten gains of NT$360,000 will be seized. Chiang was charged with passing on a large number of secret documents to his uncle, who was doing business in China at the time, in exchange for money. After the Code of Court Martial Procedure (軍事審判法) was revised in August 2013 to require civilian courts to handle cases involving military service members during peacetime, his case was turned over to the High Court, which maintained the life sentence. The Supreme Court returned the case for retrial, but the Taiwan High Court again upheld the life sentence, citing his lack of remorse. The Supreme Court rejected Chiang\u2019s appeal yesterday. The ruling is final.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/06/13/2003620610"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-13","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"CRIME Thailand jails kidnappers Two Taiwanese and four Thais were each given 22-year jail terms by Thailand\u2019s Supreme Court for their involvement in the 2009 abduction of five family members of a Taiwanese businessman, according to a Bangkok Post report on Monday.

The two priests \u2014 Barry Martinson from the US and Yves Nalet from France \u2014 have worked for many years in the mountainous areas of Hsinchu County. While residents of Jianshih (尖石) and Wufong (五峰) townships do not have much materially, their faith has become a source of strength, and many who grew up going to church in the villages said they have been deeply influenced by the priests. \u201cThey have not only brought religion, but strength, which allows you to believe that love changes everything,\u201d one parishioner said. Martinson, from California, came to work with the Chingchuan tribe (清泉部落) in Wufong more than four decades ago. Alone with no friends, Martinson said he \u201cwanted to leave and go back to my hometown.\u201d He called his mother for advice and she encouraged him to stay on for at least a year, which has now turned into 41 years. After discovering that many village children could not go to nursery school because their parents could not afford it, he founded the Sacred Heart Nursery School 12 years ago to help parents take care of their young. Several years ago, he turned a cooperative into a youth cultural center, teaching Atayal Aborigines English and fine arts. All these earned Martinson the nickname \u201cPapa Ting\u201d among township residents. Meanwhile, Father Nalet has been preaching in Jianshih Township for 21 years and has helped honey peach growers market their fruit to improve their livelihoods. Nalet has also helped impoverished junior-high school students get an education, driving the young people down the mountains each week to receive assistance in their schooling, as well as driving them back home. Although English is not his first language, he has helped the village children improve their English skills. This includes asking the children to promote their tribe in English and letting tourists see the efforts they have made. The 70-year-old priest said that the living conditions in the Aboriginal village are not good, but people are happy and content. They are optimistic and love nature, traits that are very close to his heart, he said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Two Jesuit priests honored for their service to Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/06/11/2003620445"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-11","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Taiwan firms scout land for hub","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/Taiwan-firms-scout-land-for-hub/articleshow/47621884.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-11","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"12.879721","longtitude":"121.774017","location":"Philippines"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Chinese Military Says Conducted Drills Near Taiwan, Philippines","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinese-military-says-conducted-drills-near-taiwan-philippines-770419"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"The US should consider selling additional air defense systems to Taiwan, said Mark Cozad, a former senior executive in the US Defense Intelligence Agency. While he did not detail the systems he had in mind, the senior international policy analyst at the RAND Corporation specializing in East Asia military and security issues said that they should be capable of countering ballistic missiles. In an interview published by the National Bureau of Asian Research, Cozad said: \u201cUnless the US is willing to write off Taiwan\u2019s ability to defend itself in a conflict between China and Taiwan, Washington will need to consider arms sales.\u201d He said that China had developed and purchased large numbers of \u201ccapabilities related to the US position in Taiwan.\u201d To offset these gains, the US would need to sell Taiwan air defense systems, devices to counter anti-radiation weapons, tactical air defense systems, cruise missiles and more advanced, survivable, mobile strategic air defense systems, Cozad said. TSAI FACTOR Asked how China would react if Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) won next year\u2019s presidential election and pushed to buy F-16C/D fighters from Washington, Cozad said that alone, the planes would not fundamentally change the China equation, but as part of a bigger arms package, the fighters could help enhance Taiwan\u2019s security. VOCAL AND NEGATIVE \u201cChina\u2019s response to any future arms sales to Taiwan will likely be very vocal and negative, but the practical effect beyond that will be limited,\u201d he said.

Cozad said that many questions remain about whether the F-16s would have an impact in a conflict. SURVIVABILITY \u201cSurvivability is a concern given that China and the surrounding area are a difficult operating environment for the F-16,\u201d he said. \u201cOperating locations are already limited with the air defenses China has in place and could become even more limited with the possible sale of the S-400 from Russia,\u201d he said.

Kenichi Sato, 44, comes from a long line of traditional builders of Shinto shrines and sacred architecture. He has visited Taiwan several times under the auspices of the Friends of Lee Teng-Hui Association \u2014 a group affiliated with former president Lee Teng-hui (李登輝). In one of his trips, he became acquainted with Chen Ching-fu (陳清福), who was campaigning for the preservation of the shrine in Gaoshih Village (高士), Mudan Township (牡丹). When he learned that the local community was in dire need of professionals who specialize in shrine construction, Sato promised that he would do everything he could to build a new shrine. Sato said he visited Taiwan several times to discuss the reconstruction work with local community members, including Chen, former Mudan Township warden Hua A-tsai (華阿財), Paiwan community leader Lee Wen-lai (李文來) and Gaoshih Village Warden Lee Te-fu (李德福). It took Sato a year to build a miniature shrine \u2014 which is 230cm tall, 166cm wide and weighs 400kg \u2014 from cypress, with a copper gabled roof. The shrine also has a decorative bargeboard that is carved into a triangular dormer on the undulating gable, he said. Wearing a Shinto priest\u2019s robe, Sato escorted the new shrine to the Port of Yokohama in Japan on May 18, where the structure was consigned to a Japanese transporter for shipping to Kaohsiung. Sato said he personally bore the expense of shipment and all other costs incurred, including customs inspection and cargo loading, which amounted to about ￥500,000.

Unveiled over the past few days, it is made by Shenyang Aircraft Corp and is a high-altitude long-endurance uncrewed aircraft that makes potential targets in Taiwan more vulnerable. \u201cFor Taiwan, countering this new threat may require a much larger and longer-range air-to-air missile,\u201d military analyst Rick Fisher of the International Assessment and Strategy Center told the Taipei Times. Fisher said the new drone could provide real-time targeting information to China\u2019s \u201chighly accurate\u201d ballistic and cruise missiles. \u201cThis means that China has a new tool to prevent US and Japanese forces from aiding Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThe Shen Diao will also help Chinese air and naval forces to contest the area out to the second island chain, which could allow the Chinese military to surround Taiwan.\u201d Fisher said the drone could help Beijing consolidate its control over the South China Sea in cooperation with Chinese air and naval forces \u201csoon to be based on its new large reclaimed island bases.\u201d If China\u2019s military communications satellites are attacked, the drone could serve as a temporary replacement \u201cproviding a vital redundancy for China to continue military operations against Taiwan,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Shen Diao adds to the credibility of the threat from China\u2019s current and future longer range anti-ship ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, in that it can provide targeting data that is more persistent than from satellites,\u201d he said. The drone is believed to be larger than the US Air Force\u2019s Global Hawk surveillance drone. Military and intelligence analyst Bill Gertz has reported that it has a twin fuselage configuration that allows it to carry more fuel and numerous active electronically scanned array radars, as well as tracking sensors capable of following enemy fighter jets and cruise missiles. A report in Popular Science magazine said that the drone was first flown in February. It is part of China\u2019s long-range, well-funded military buildup, US House Armed Services Committee member Representative J. Randy Forbes said. He said the drone would advance targeting capabilities that China could use in an anti-access, area-denial campaign.","source":"taiwan","title":"New PRC drone a threat to Taiwan, US analyst says","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/06/03/2003619814"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-03","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Computex 2015: Startups Key as Taiwan Seeks New Tech Identity","url":"http://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/features/computex-2015-startups-key-as-taiwan-seeks-new-tech-identity-698845"},"time":{"from":"2015-06-02","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Taiwanese-American NBA player Jeremy Lin (林書豪), who has mostly been a backup player during his past year with the Los Angeles Lakers, is to arrive at Taiwan on June 28 for a one-week visit before seeking a new contract with other teams in the NBA.

The institute is a foundation established by the Ministry of Culture charged with restoring and promoting the nation\u2019s film heritage. Institute chief executive Lin Wen-chi (林文淇) said that following the 1955 end of a ban on producing movies in Hoklo (also known as Taiwanese), hundreds of movies in the language were produced every year until the end of the 1960s, when the move to color films undermined the competitiveness of independent Hoklo film producers. The 1970s saw the emergence of romantic movies and a genre of \u201cnew wave\u201d wuxia (martial arts, 武俠) films, which were commercially successful in eastern Asia, he said. Time has not been kind to the older movies, which are only now beginning to be digitized and restored, Deputy Minister of Culture Joseph Chen (陳永豐) said. He said that many films have already been lost or irreparably damaged due to poor preservation methods, adding that during Taiwan\u2019s economic rise, discarded movie-film was often used as waterproof lining in the straw hats of factory workers. He estimated that only 400 Hoklo films have been preserved. Ten older films in either Holko or Mandarin have been fully digitized and restored by the institute. The movie exhibition \u2014 set to tour the nation from next month through August \u2014 features six classic films from the 1960s and 1970s. Films featured include Dragon Gate Inn (龍門客棧), the wuxia film that marked the beginning of the \u201cnew wave\u201d pictures. The restored version was featured at the Cannes Film Festival last year. The romantic drama The Young Ones (彩雲飛) \u2014 based on a novel by famous pulp-romance author Chiung Yao (瓊瑤) \u2014 similarly presaged a wave of successful romance films. The exhibit includes Love in Chilly Spring (春寒), starring singer Feng Fei-fei (鳳飛飛), as well the three older Hoklo films: Back to Anping Harbor (回來安平港), Vengeance of the Phoenix Sisters (三鳳震武林) and The Fantasy of Deer Warrior (大俠梅花鹿).

She said that, as far as Tsai\u2019s visit goes, the US is not in the business of supporting a particular candidate or a particular candidate\u2019s positions. \u201cWe hope during the visit to make clear the US\u2019 interest is in cross-strait stability,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cClose communication, no surprises and a low-key approach have been the key to success in recent years and we hope to see that continue.\u201d Thornton said that the US hoped to learn from Tsai about her vision for taking Taiwan and US-Taiwan relations forward. \u201cWe want to see continued stable, positive interactions across the [Taiwan] Strait. We believe there has been a firm basis established for those interactions and dialogue, and we are interested in seeing that continued because of the benefits it has brought to Taiwan and the US,\u201d she said. The US remained committed to the \u201cone China\u201d policy based on the three communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act, she said. Despite repeated questioning, Thornton refused to characterize, define or comment on the so-called \u201c1992 consensus.\u201d The \u201c1992 consensus,\u201d a term former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi (蘇起) admitted making up in 2000, refers to a tacit understanding between the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means. \u201cWe are proud of what Taiwan has accomplished and proud of the role the US has played in Taiwan\u2019s success,\u201d Thornton said. She told a packed meeting at the Brookings Institution that US President Barack Obama\u2019s administration had worked to \u201creconceptualize and reinstitutionalize\u201d US-Taiwan relations and build a \u201ccomprehensive, durable and mutually beneficial partnership.\u201d She said that the US was committed to promoting Taiwan\u2019s economic prosperity and to elevating Taiwan\u2019s \u201cprofile and dignity\u201d through its contributions to global challenges and the international community. Thornton said that US arms sales to Taiwan supported improved relations across the Strait by providing Taiwan with the confidence to pursue constructive interactions with China.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan a vital partner for US: official","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/23/2003618962"},"time":{"from":"2015-05-23","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Taiwan and Japan must mend trade ties","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/05/22/2003618850"},"time":{"from":"2015-05-22","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"The Iwate Prefectural Government has begun issuing certificates of origin for farm, fishery and processed food exports to comply with tougher rules adopted by Taiwan last week.

Unlike traditional, manual methods of launching mortars, the system allows personnel to launch mortars through a computerized system \u201cwhich is completely developed locally,\u201d Chen told reporters during a tour of the 202nd Arsenal\u2019s Taipei unit. The system is very easy to operate; as long as you can play video games, you will know how to operate it,\u201d he said.

Advantages of the system include better aim stability and faster deployment, he said. \u201cI feel proud that we developed the system on our own,\u201d Chen said, adding that nations such as Israel, South Africa and the US have similar systems. The system includes a function to simulate the firing of a mortar. During the tour, a five-member group from the 202nd Arsenal demonstrated a simulated firing of mortars through the system, which targeted Taipei 101, about 3.8km away.

The most valued aspect of the wetland area is that it hosts the endangered black-faced spoonbill, the Taipei-based Chinese Wild Bird Federation said, adding that the number of black-faced spoonbills recorded in the wetland in the five years to last year was five, 55, 56, 154 and 285 respectively. Last year\u2019s figure was a record high, conservationists said, adding that the wetland is home to more than 150 bird species. SPORTS Nation hosts female boxers The AIBA Women\u2019s Junior and Youth World Championships, which is to be hosted by Taiwan for the first time, will be open to the public free of charge, New Taipei City\u2019s Sport Office said.

TOURISM Delayed passengers flown in TransAsia Airways yesterday brought 97 passengers from Japan after their flight had been severely delayed due to mechanical problems. The flight departed from Chitose Airport at 10pm on Wednesday, landing at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 1am yesterday. The 97 passengers were some of the 192 passengers who were scheduled to travel to Taiwan on TransAsia flight GE671 at 1:15pm on Tuesday. The plane developed problems with its hydraulic braking system and had to be towed off the runway upon landing in Japan on an earlier flight. TransAsia denied Japanese media reports that the plane had to make an emergency landing. TransAsia said 85 of the 192 passengers booked on the return flight to Taiwan took other airlines on Wednesday afternoon, while 10 changed their return date and the remainder waited for TransAsia to provide a new flight.

At the same time, the Project 2049 Institute wants the White House to increase security assistance to Taiwan. This comes in a new study from the think tank, published as US Secretary of State John Kerry prepares to meet senior Chinese leaders in Beijing this weekend to discuss China\u2019s growing maritime claims. \u201cThe US should work more closely with Taiwan,\u201d the study by institute researcher Kelsey Broderick said in the study. Taipei has proposed President Ma Ying-jeou\u2019s (馬英九) East China Sea peace initiative, which calls for setting aside territorial disputes in favor of joint development of resources. \u201cPrinciples behind this proposal could easily be applied to the South China Sea and should be promoted by both Taiwan and the US,\u201d the study said. \u201cPutting aside sovereignty issues in favor of shared development would help build ties between all the claimant countries in a way that might help with peaceful resolution of claims in the future,\u201d it said. The US strategy of pivoting to Asia should be tailored more toward bolstering this type of coordination with Taiwan, the study added. \u201cOne way is for Obama to end the freeze on meaningful arms sales to Taiwan and provide Taiwan with submarine assistance in order to help Taiwan upgrade its navy, its most important deterrent in these types of maritime disputes,\u201d the study said. Other collaboration with Taiwan could include joint humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercises, \u201carea[s] that could play an important role in any South China Sea flare-ups,\u201d it said. This kind of US cooperation with Taiwan would clearly to signal China that aggressive actions have consequences, it added. \u201cCurrently, China is acting as though the US rebalance is nothing more than a policy of rhetoric,\u201d the study said. \u201cBeijing may even be willing to militarily reinforce its claims in the South China Sea if it believes that the US rebalance is nothing more than empty discourse.\u201d However, by quickly and firmly instituting the rebalance before China further develops its naval capabilities, the US can establish itself as a dominant presence in Asia, it added. \u201cForcing China to resolve its South China Sea disputes now, when its military capabilities in the region remain relatively weak, will make it more likely that the disputes will be solved peacefully,\u201d Broderick wrote.","source":"taiwan","title":"US should bolster Taiwan in S China Sea: think tank","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/14/2003618254"},"time":{"from":"2015-05-14","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Taiwan and Japan tied for fourth place in a global math and science education ranking administered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with Asian nations taking the top five spots, the BBC reported yesterday.

Learning about the TIA incident came as a shock to him, inspiring him to dig more into history and make the film with three other friends, who were also born in the 1990s. The TIA incident refers to a case in which the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice arrested four people \u2014 NTHU student Liao Wei-chen (廖偉程), Aboriginal rights activist Masao Nikar, political activist Wang Hsiu-hui (王秀惠) and historian Chen Cheng-jen (陳正然) \u2014 accused them of having been directed by Tokyo-based TIA founder Su to organize activities for Taiwan independence and charged them with sedition. According to the now-defunct Punishment of Rebellion Act (懲治叛亂條例), the four would receive the death penalty if found guilty. The arrests triggered student strikes and demonstrations across the nation, including a student-led occupation of the Taipei Railway Station to protest what was seen as the government\u2019s suppression of the freedom of expression. Pressured, the legislature abolished the Punishment of Rebellion Act nine days later on May 17, 1990, and the four were immediately freed. Liao Chien-hua said that he and his friends made the film to remind the public about the event. To get a full picture of what happened, the team interviewed more than 40 people, from the victims, activists and their friends, to former officials, such as then-Investigation Bureau director-general Wu Tung-ming (吳東明) and People First Party Chairman James Soong (宋楚瑜), who was the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) secretary-general at the time. However, when the team also requested an interview with former president Lee Teng-hui (李登輝), who was in power at the time, Lee declined, saying that he did not remember much about the event. A public screening of the film is to be held next Sunday in the lobby of Taipei Railway Station to coincide with the anniversary of the group\u2019s release, and a student demonstration scene is to be reproduced at the railway station as well.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan Independence Association film director sought history of recent times","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/10/2003617938"},"time":{"from":"2015-05-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Taiwan is a key component of US Asia-Pacific policies, including the rebalance to Asia, US Secretary of State John Kerry said in a written statement on Thursday. \u201cThe US continues to expand and enhance its strong and multifaceted unofficial relationship with Taiwan,\u201d he said in a formal answer to questions asked more than two months ago by Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives\u2019 Foreign Affairs Committee. Kerry\u2019s statement came just three days after Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) met with Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) and reaffirmed Beijing\u2019s support for closer cross-strait economic ties. While Kerry made no mention of the Chu-Xi meeting, he appeared to be reassuring Taipei that it still had strong US support. \u201cTaiwan is an important security and economic partner of the US, an important part of global value chains, a vibrant democracy and our 10th largest trading partner,\u201d Kerry said. He said the US would continue deepening its engagement with Taipei on trade and investment issues through the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) process and that the US welcomed Taiwan\u2019s interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). \u201cWe work cooperatively with Taiwan in APEC to promote regional economic integration initiatives, including enhanced trade and investment,\u201d he said.

Their fusion of seasonal menus and slick interiors at modest prices is starting to create an international buzz \u2014 Conde Nast Traveller magazine has labeled Taiwan as the \u201cfoodie destination of 2015.\u201d The nation\u2019s star chef, Andre Chiang (江振誠) \u2014 who trained in France and runs the acclaimed Restaurant Andre in Singapore \u2014 recently opened his first venue on home turf, RAW, in northern Taipei. It serves up seasonal Taiwanese produce crafted into what Chiang calls a \u201cnew interpretation\u201d of the island\u2019s culinary traditions. \u201cThey are all humble ingredients \u2014 but when you start to match them in a different way, you create something interesting,\u201d he said. RAW\u2019s seven-course menu changes every month and features 21 Taiwanese ingredients in peak season at the time. Tiny shrimp nestle inside purple rice crackers; three types of cauliflower are layered onto thin wafers of chicken skin; a version of the island\u2019s famed sweet treat, the pineapple cake, is presented as three semi-frozen cubes. The full tasting menu costs NT$1,850, which Chiang calls \u201caccessible\u201d compared with the nation\u2019s more expensive fine-dining options, mostly the preserve of high-end hotels. RAW, which opened in December last year, is part of 38-year-old Chiang\u2019s mission to help carve out a fresh global identity for Taiwan. \u201cWe used to be Taiwanese, with Aboriginal local cuisine, then we were colonized for 50 years by the Japanese, then there was the takeover by the Chinese government. We can\u2019t cut [those influences] out of our history,\u201d he said. Now entrepreneurial restaurateurs are finding their feet, and it is not just about the food. \u201cSmall independent restaurants ... are starting to take Taiwanese local produce and are doing it in a more international way, with both the cuisine and the design,\u201d Chiang said. The cavernous space at RAW, designed by Dutch architect Camiel Weijenberg, is dominated by two huge curved wooden counters made from Taiwanese spruce by local artisans. The city\u2019s growing reputation for creativity led Taipei to be named World Design Capital for next year by the International Council of the Societies of Industrial Design. \u201cPeople have studied abroad and are bringing ideas back with them \u2014 a lot has changed in the last year or two ... there\u2019s a big transition at the moment,\u201d Weijenberg said. At new restaurant Mume, three young chefs use Taiwanese produce to create Western dishes in a bid to fill the gap between simple island fare and pricey fine dining. The cosy 32-seat venue decked out in dark wood and storm lamps also opened in December last year, tucked away in a quiet street in Taipei\u2019s Daan District (大安). \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get quite a lot of international travelers, probably 20 to 30 percent,\u201d said Hong Kong-born founder and chef Richie Lin, 34, who works with Australian chef Kai Ward, 24, and US chef Long Xiong, 32.

At the inaugural event in Taipei yesterday, members and supporters announced the formation of the Taiwan Independence Party (TIP, 台灣獨立黨), and unveiled the party\u2019s insignia, banner and charter. Following a balloting session, the party members elected Chen Chao-ming (陳兆銘) as the first-term party chairman. Chen has been active in the Taiwanese National Congress (台灣民族同盟) movement, and has headed the Taiwan Guardian Group (台灣守護隊), a community service organization that employs street protests to challenge the authorities. Chen said the TIP would join next year\u2019s legislative election, nominating candidates to campaign on the political platform of home rule for Taiwanese, Taiwanese national sovereignty and independence, abolishing the \u201cfraudulent\u201d ROC regime and declaring the birth of a new nation named Taiwan that would join the UN. \u201cWe will be a force to be reckoned with, as part of the pro-Taiwan coalition of political groups and parties in the election. We advocate for revolutionary actions, to overthrow the ROC regime, for the formation of an independent, sovereign Taiwan nation,\u201d he added. Chen said the TIP has many younger members, and has youthful, revolutionary energy to make a big impact in cyberspace, where the battle for Taiwanese nationalism and the Taiwanese people\u2019s newfound identity will be fought against the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and its China-centric mentality. Among the supporters and groups who attended to help launch the TIP were Kao Chin-lang (高金郎), an author and former political prisoner who participated in the famous \u201cTaiyuan Insurrection\u201d (泰源起義) against the KMT regime in 1970; Huang Kuo-hua (黃國華), chairman of the Taiwan Government Party (台灣建國黨); prominent Sunflower movement leader Wang Yi-kai (王奕凱), and National Taiwan University of Science and Technology computer science professor Ted Lau (劉重義).

The man told firefighters that he had hung up his jeans on Sunday night and had discovered the swarm of bees on Tuesday after heavy overnight rain.

Other factors considered were price competitiveness, environmental sustainability, air transportation infrastructure, ground and port infrastructure, tourist service infrastructure, natural resources, and cultural and business travel. Taiwan scored 4.35 on a 1 to 7 point scale to come 32nd on the list of most friendly travel destinations in the world, the report said. In terms of individual categories, Taiwan ranked higher in areas such as business environment (21st), security and safety (24th), cultural resources and business travel (23rd), and human resources and labor market (25th). The report said Taiwan failed to become one of the top destinations for foreign travelers, but stands a chance of climbing in the global rankings if it improves its travel infrastructure. Spain topped the list, scoring high in terms of cultural resources, infrastructure and adaptation to digital consumption habits.

The DPP\u2019s campaign budget is bigger than in previous elections because it is anticipating more votes, which means it will be eligible to receive a bigger government subsidy for campaign funding, Cheng said. The NT$200 million is to be mainly used to run the party\u2019s headquarters, Cheng said. He said DPP candidates would be responsible for funding their own campaign offices. The presidential and legislative elections are in January next year. Regulations stipulate that presidential and vice presidential candidates may establish accounts for political donations beginning on May 20. The DPP will continue its efforts to attract funding from smaller donors, Cheng said.

After the meltdown of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in the wake of an earthquake on March 11, 2011, Taiwan banned foods from several nuclear-affected Japanese prefectures.

At the event, Ma lauded the agreement by citing statistics from the ministry which purported to show reduced crime in both Taiwan and China, decreases in financial corruption and an upturn in the crime clearance rates.

Chinese authorities turned down requests to repatriate these fugitives\u2019 illegal financial gains back to Taiwan, they said, adding that over the past six years, the Chinese Supreme People\u2019s Court only repatriated swindled money back to Taiwanese victims in three cases, totaling NT$11.6 million (US$373,600).

Titled The Need for a Stable US-China Balance of Power, it says that while the US is set to remain the strongest military power on a global level indefinitely, it might not always be able to keep up with China in the area covered by the so-called first and second island chains. \u201cA continuing US capacity to shift military assets from other parts of the globe to Asia in a crisis or conflict could conceivably correct America\u2019s relative military decline in the western Pacific,\u201d Swaine said in the report. However, such a surge-based \u201csolution\u201d would require considerable time to implement, while Chinese military action against Taiwan \u201cwould almost certainly involve a very rapid strike aimed at establishing a fait accompli that could prove extremely difficult and costly to undo,\u201d he said. Swaine is described by Carnegie as \u201cone of the most prominent American analysts in Chinese security studies.\u201d He said in the report that neutralizing the cross-strait threat would require the US to cut arms sales to Taiwan in return for verifiable limits on Chinese ballistic missiles and strike aircraft deployed near Taiwan. \u201cBeijing would also likely need to provide credible assurances that it would not use force against Taiwan in any conceivable contingency short of an outright Taiwanese declaration of de jure independence or the US placement of forces on the island,\u201d Swaine said. He said Beijing might view such a conditional limitation of its right to employ force as acceptable if viewed as a requirement for the creation of an overall stable balance of power in the western Pacific. \u201cChinese leaders might also regard it as a step toward the eventual unification of the island with the mainland,\u201d Swaine said. He said that US decisionmakers are \u201cextremely loath\u201d to make significant adjustments in the current status of the Korean Peninsula or Taiwan. \u201cAny movement toward a reduction in or even a significant modification of the US security commitment to these two actors could result in either moving to acquire nuclear arms and/or threats or attacks from North Korea or China,\u201d he said. However, if understandings could be reached on the overall need for strategic adjustment, then specific concessions to minimize potential instabilities would become more possible. Swaine concludes the report by saying that if both US and Chinese leaders could convince Taipei of the benefits of mutual assurances and restraints \u2014 none of which would require US abandonment of Taiwan \u2014 adverse outcomes, including a resort to nuclear weapons, could be avoided.","source":"taiwan","title":"Beijing \u2018too passive\u2019 over Taiwan: Chinese analysts","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/04/25/2003616749"},"time":{"from":"2015-04-25","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"SOCIETY \u2018Blue-collar\u2019 APRC coming The Ministry of Labor plans to allow certain migrant workers in Taiwan to apply for permanent residence, Minister of Labor Chen Hsiung-wen (陳雄文) said on Wednesday.

Officials from national soccer body the Chinese Taipei Football Association (CTFA) reiterated that claims made by the Chinese-language Next Magazine were not true and that they are considering suing for libel and seeking damages. According to a report published in the magazine on Wednesday, prosecutors are investigating allegations that CTFA chairman Lin Cheng-yi (林振義) bet on a recent FIFA World Cup Asian qualifier for the national team to lose, for which Lin allegedly reaped NT$40 million (US$1.28 million). Head coach Chen Kuei-jen (陳貴人) supported the CTFA officials\u2019 consideration of a lawsuit against the magazine in order to clear up the matter, as well as to restore his and the national team\u2019s reputation and regain the trust of the public. \u201cThere is no basis to the accusation.

The match that Next Magazine said Lin had rigged was the March 12 home leg in Kaohsiung of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Asian qualifier, in which Taiwan lost to Brunei 1-0.

Sponsored by US Representative Matt Salmon, chairman of the US House of Representatives\u2019 Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, the bill would require Obama to submit an official request on Taiwan\u2019s behalf to Interpol. It would also require the White House to encourage Interpol members to support an application from Taiwan for observer status. The bill has bipartisan backing, including that of the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, US Representative Ed Royce, and ranking member US Representative Eliot Engel. Capitol Hill insiders expect the bill to quickly win committee approval and go before the House of Representatives for a vote. It is part of a more general move by House Republicans to gain more international presence for the nation. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s observer status would promote stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region and assist Taiwan in protecting the safety of its citizens by combatting criminal activity through access to Interpol\u2019s global police communications systems,\u201d Salmon said. Taiwan currently relies on the US and other countries to informally pass along Interpol information on relevant criminal activity. \u201cWith the rise of terrorism throughout the globe, not allowing Taiwan independent and easy access to Interpol is an unnecessary and dangerous risk,\u201d Salmon said. Taiwan was a full member of Interpol from 1964 until 1984, when the People\u2019s Republic of China applied for membership. A recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said that since 1984, Taiwan\u2019s National Police Agency had cooperated with Interpol on several criminal cases, but had been unable to cooperate on a routine basis. \u201cTaiwan should be permitted access to Interpol\u2019s network so that it can both contribute to and benefit from what would be a more comprehensive fight against international criminals across the globe,\u201d the study said. Interpol membership rules allow police bodies that are not members of the organization to act as observers. According to the CSIS study, Taiwan\u2019s \u201cindistinct status\u201d and Beijing\u2019s continued opposition prevent full membership in Interpol. \u201cTaiwan has appealed multiple times for its membership to be restored, but to no avail,\u201d the study said. It said that Taiwan is forced to acquire second-hand information on international criminals and criminal activity from friendly countries, but that this information is provided only on request and is often outdated and incomprehensive. As a result, the study said Taiwan is left vulnerable to international crime inside its borders. The new bill comes as US Secretary of State John Kerry has issued a statement describing Taiwan as a fundamental element of Obama\u2019s \u201crebalancing\u201d to Asia. Kerry said the US would continue to strengthen, expand and improve its solid and multi-sided unofficial relations with Taiwan.","source":"taiwan","title":"US Taiwan-Interpol bill introduced","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/04/18/2003616214"},"time":{"from":"2015-04-18","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Civic group leaders and members yesterday joined students and Sunflower movement activists in launching the nation\u2019s newest political party, which its chief organizer, Tsay Ting-kuei (蔡丁貴), said would be named the Free Taiwan Party (自由台灣黨).

The crude incidence rate showed that about 415 people developed cancer per 100,000 population in 2012, which represents one out of every 233 Taiwanese, Chiou said. Aside from liver and stomach cancer \u2014 which both showed declining incidence rates for three consecutive years \u2014 the incidence for other cancers on the list of the 10 most prevalent increased during this period, the statistics showed. The statistics also saw cervical cancer dropping off the top 10 list for the first time since the government started keeping records, while thyroid carcinoma made the list for the first time, in ninth position. Of the 96,694 people who were diagnosed with cancer in 2012, the majority, or 14,965, developed colorectal cancer, followed by lung cancer (11,692), liver cancer (11,422), breast cancer (10,525) and oral cancer (7,047). Rounding out the top 10 list were prostate cancer (4,735 people), stomach cancer (3,796), skin cancer (3,274), thyroid carcinoma (2,895) and esophageal cancer (2,372). Compared with the 2011 statistics, significant increases were observed in the incidence rates for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer and thyroid carcinoma, up by 1.6 people, 1.3 people, one person and one person per 100,000 population respectively, Chiou said. She attributed the increasing prevalence of cancer to unhealthy lifestyles, including obesity, smoking, drinking, lack of exercise, excessive consumption of meat and high-fat products, and insufficient intake of fruits and vegetables. \u201cA majority of the 10 most common cancers are associated with obesity. Research has shown that women who are overweight are 1.6 times more susceptible to breast cancer than their average-weight counterparts. Thyroid carcinoma is also known to mostly strike young obese women, or those exposed to radiation,\u201d Chiou said. Lack of dietary fiber intake and exercise are also linked with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, Chiou said, while squamous cell carcinoma, oral and esophageal cancers are more common among individuals who regularly smoke and drink than those who do not. Chiou said leading a healthy lifestyle and undergoing regular screening tests are the two most effective ways in warding off cancer. \u201cMost of the early-stage cancer cases diagnosed in 2012 were detected by screenings, including 90.6 percent for cervical cancer, 85.3 percent for breast cancer and 60.1 percent for colorectal cancer,\u201d Chiou said. \u201cSuch patients tend to have a higher five-year survival rate, at nearly 70 percent, than those who discover cancer at advanced stages.\u201d","source":"taiwan","title":"Cancer diagnosis statistics show increase in Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/04/15/2003615980"},"time":{"from":"2015-04-15","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Taiwan and the US are still discussing when to hold the next round of talks under the bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said yesterday. \u201cWe\u2019re still discussing it with the US,\u201d Department of North American Affairs Director-General Kelly Hsieh (謝武樵) told a regular news briefing. Hsieh was responding to questions on the timing of the major trade talks between Taiwan and the US, which have been held in March or April the past two years. Minister of Economic Affairs John Deng (鄧振中) previously said that it was unlikely that the next round of TIFA talks would be held this month, despite having said in February, during a visit to the US, that the talks would take place this month. Deng said the delay was because the US has focused its trade negotiation efforts on issues such as finishing negotiations on the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade bloc. There were also suspicions that the delay might be related to Taiwan\u2019s resistance to expanding imports of US beef and pork, but Hsieh did not say yesterday whether they factored into the delay, saying only that the government has had a consistent stance on the issue. He said Taiwan will continue its ban on imports of cow internal organs from the US, but will move to open its doors to six other kinds of beef parts from the US as long as their safety is ensured. Taiwan will also maintain its ban on imports of US pork that contains traces of ractopamine, a veterinary leanness-enhancing drug banned in the nation, Hsieh said. Taiwan also previously prohibited imports of beef containing ractopamine, but it lifted the ban in July 2012, setting the stage for the resumption of TIFA talks in March 2013 after a six-year suspension caused largely by the dispute over beef imports from the US. The TIFA was signed in 1994 as a framework for Taiwan-US dialogue on trade-related issues. The last round of TIFA talks were held in Washington in April last year. Asked about a recent report in which US officials suggested that Taiwan address the beef and pork issues if it wanted to speed up the process of joining the TPP, Hsieh said Taiwan understands Washington\u2019s stance. Both sides will continue to negotiate, he said, adding that bilateral communication under the TIFA is smooth.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan-US still discussing next round of TIFA talks","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/04/15/2003615976"},"time":{"from":"2015-04-15","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Several pro-localization groups yesterday urged former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman Hsu Hsin-liang (許信良) and DPP member and former Straits Exchange Foundation chairman Hung Chi-chang (洪奇昌) to stop meddling in the DPP and the younger generation\u2019s pursuit of Taiwanese independence.

DIPLOMACY Soldier ad draws warning The Bureau Francais de Taipei said it is not aware of any recruitment efforts by the French Foreign Legion in the nation and suspects a scam after local media outlets reported the office was recruiting Taiwanese to work in France for high salaries. Local reports have been covering an employment agency advertisement that promised prospective Taiwanese mercenaries yearly salaries of at least 40,000 euros (US$42,300), and permanent residency in France if they are chosen by the Foreign Legion and complete at least five years of service. The bureau said that according to the law, the Foreign Legion is only authorized to recruit on French soil, adding that it is unlikely that the military service wing of the French Army would require the services of a Taiwanese employment agency for recruits. Recruitment requirements listed by the advertisement stipulated that candidates must be less than 40 years old and have no history of tuberculosis. It also asks for NT$69,000 in consultation fees, which excludes air fares, accommodation and other expenses accumulated prior to visiting one of the legion\u2019s recruitment centers in France. The bureau advised people to be wary of such advertisements.

The forum comes at a sensitive time because the KMT\u2019s presidential hopefuls must register for the party\u2019s presidential primary by May 18. This has triggered speculation that Chu would not take part in the primary if he attends the forum, to avoid the impression that he has been handpicked by China to be the party\u2019s presidential candidate.

The firm on Thursday cited data from last year placing Taiwan in third place, behind South Korea and Hong Kong, in terms of the volume of advanced persistent threat (APT) activities in the Asia-Pacific region. Tony Cole, vice president and global government chief technology officer at FireEye, a publicly listed US company, said at a press conference in Taipei that due to Taiwan\u2019s position within an intense geopolitical rivalry between major powers and its technology firms\u2019 possession of important information coveted by APT hackers, companies in Taiwan are more prone to cyberattacks than those in other countries. An APT is a type of cyberintrusion in which an unauthorized person gains access to a network and maintains this access undetected for an extended period of time. The purpose of an APT attack is to steal data rather than to cause damage. The number of APT activities directed against Taiwanese companies in the fourth quarter of last year saw a 26 percent upsurge from the previous quarter. For the whole of last year, Taiwanese businesses experienced a quarterly increase of 6.6 percent of overall APT attacks, according to the FireEye study. Cole said that APT activities made their first appearance well before last year, but many enterprises were not aware of the rampant cyberattacks until last year. Companies have managed to reduce the amount of time it takes them to detect a cyberattack, Cole said, adding that it took an average of 243 days before organizations realized hackers had infiltrated their network in 2012, but it took 229 days in 2013 and 205 days last year.

The seven shipments of food items cannot be allowed into Taiwan and are to be returned to Japan, the FDA said.

Although the committee\u2019s members span the political spectrum, they had arrived at a consensus on the \u201cpremise\u201d of any cross-city talks involving China, Ko said. \u201cThe premise [of cross-city talks] is mutual love, trust and understanding,\u201d Ko said. \u201cMutual love is viewing both sides [of the Taiwan Strait] as a \u2018close family\u2019 \u2014 a \u2018close family\u2019 is better than a \u2018family of enemies.\u2019\u201d The mayor\u2019s reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s (習近平) buzz phrase \u2014 \u201cviewing both sides of the Strait as a close family\u201d \u2014 is being interpreted as a friendly gesture to the Chinese government. Xi has used the phrase to describe his vision for cross-strait ties in lieu of Beijing\u2019s traditional terms such as \u201cpeaceful reunification\u201d and \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d Ko\u2019s remarks come amid uncertainty over the future of the annual Taipei-Shanghai forums, which began in 2010. Ko\u2019s role in directing the forum has attracted interest over whether he, as an independent, will have more leeway in taking a position on the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d that Beijing insists must be the premise of cross-strait talks, than someone from the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) or Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would have. Ko has thus far avoided taking a position on the \u201cconsensus,\u201d which refers to a supposed understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government reached during cross-strait talks in 1992 that both Taiwan and China acknowledge there is \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what that means. Ko said the committee also agreed that there should be broader civic participation in cross-city talks, instead of just the business and corporate leaders who have been invited to past forums. The mayor has previously also called for the forum to be expanded to include other cities. Ko said that the objective of any talks would be to \u201cfurther dialogue and increase goodwill\u201d, while reiterating that they would need to be in accordance with his principle of \u201cfour mutuals:\u201d mutual knowing, understanding, respecting and cooperating. The city\u2019s Mainland Affairs Committee is directly below the mayor\u2019s office.

About 200 students and activists broke through security lines and seized the main legislative chamber on March 18 last year, in what became known as the Sunflower movement, with thousands of supporters rallying on the streets of the capital Taipei. The demonstrations were sparked by a service sector trade pact with China that protesters said had been secretly settled. Their anger reflected wider discontent over ties with China, which have improved under the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), who came to power in 2008. While the thaw has led to trade agreements and a tourist boom, some feel ordinary people have seen little benefit and there are growing fears over Beijing\u2019s influence. By bringing those anxieties to the fore, the movement had a dramatic impact. \u201cThe fast-paced exchanges between the two sides [China and Taiwan] in the past seven years have slowed and halted amid concerns over Taiwan\u2019s security, manifested by the movement,\u201d National Chengchi University political analyst Tung Chen-yuan (童振源) said. \u201cThe Sunflower movement was a turning point in the development of cross-strait ties,\u201d he added. It also encouraged people to express their wider frustrations with the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), National Taiwan University professor of political science Wang Yeh-lih (王業立) said. \u201cThe KMT was concerned about issues such as the service trade pact and internationalization, but the people cared about their pockets and housing prices... public discontent that had been accumulating was set off,\u201d he said. The Beijing-friendly KMT suffered its worst-ever local election defeat in November last year \u2014 a vote seen as a key barometer for next year\u2019s presidential race. It has since been careful to couch its approach to relations with China. \u201cThe movement dealt a big blow to the KMT... It triggered a domino effect against the government\u201d over controversial policies, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng (吳育昇) said. Politicians now pay \u201cmore attention to the opinions of netizens, young people and civil groups in making policies. It is good for democracy\u201d, he said. The traditionally China-skeptic Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) gained from the election result, but is keen not to be seen as complacent in the face of an empowered electorate. \u201cPublic sentiments are against the KMT, but there are risks, as well as opportunities, for us,\u201d in next year\u2019s polls, DPP spokesperson Cheng Yun-peng (鄭運鵬) said. The DPP now has to tread a line between cross-strait trade, which could benefit Taiwan, and voters\u2019 wishes.

The High Court convicted Hao in April last year on charges of selling information about Taiwan\u2019s E-2K all-weather airborne warning and control system to Chinese intelligence agencies via businessman Wan Tsung-lin (萬宗琳). The ruling is final. Wan, a karaoke club owner, was also found guilty last year of complicity and sentenced to 14-and-a-half years in prison. Their actions were uncovered during the investigation in 2013 of another case of alleged espionage, which led prosecutors to a money trail that involved Wan and Hao, who was serving in the 439 Combined Wing at the Pingtung Air Base at the time. The two men were arrested in March last year on charges of violating the National Security Act (國家安全法) and leaking classified military information.

TRANSPORTATION Taichung rail nears fruition A 21.7km elevated railway project being built in Taichung is expected to commence services by the end of the year, the Railway Reconstruction Bureau said yesterday. The project will be completed by the end of the month, bureau officials said. The elevated railway, costing about NT$37.24 billion (US$1.18 billion), was designed to replace the current ground-level railway line that runs through downtown. The project is to eliminate 17 railroad crossings, 18 underpasses and three overpasses, freeing the city from the gridlock caused by the existing railway. As of January, Taichung had a population of 2.72 million, making it the nation\u2019s third-most populous city after New Taipei City with 3.97 million and Kaohsiung with 2.78 million, Ministry of the Interior statistics showed. CRIME Expert to assist investigation Kaohsiung authorities have asked renowned forensic scientist Henry Lee (李昌鈺) to assist with the investigation of a prison hostage crisis in the city last month that ended with the six hostage-takers apparently committing suicide. Lee said in Taipei on Monday that he was reviewing documents related to the case and is expected to discuss the case with Kaohsiung prosecutors and police tomorrow. The hostage crisis began on Feb. 11 when six inmates in Kaohsiung Prison overtook guards and prison officials and stole rifles and handguns in a breakout attempt. The crisis ended early on the morning of Feb. 12 when the prisoners allegedly committed suicide after police surrounded the compound. The hostages were unharmed.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/03/18/2003613836"},"time":{"from":"2015-03-18","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"SOCIETY Phillips memorial to be held The Taipei American School (TAS) has organized a celebration on Sunday to commemorate Hope Phillips, a long-time staff member who died on Jan. 22 in Washington.

The headquarters said that the jellyfish usually appears every year between November and January near the Dongsha Atoll National Park, but only on its northern coast. However, this year, they have also been spotted on the southern coast. Dongsha, one of the Pratas Islands (Dongsha Islands, 東沙群島), is an atoll in the South China Sea. The venomous tentacles of the Portuguese man o\u2019war, so-named because of its resemblance to Portuguese warships of the 15th and 16th centuries, can deliver a painful sting.

The Department of Railways and Highways said that Uber has proposed that the service it offers be categorized as a new type of transport service, apart from the three types of the transport services recognized by the Transportation Management Regulations (汽車運輸業管理規則). The ministry also said that the company asked to be exempt from any tax obligations as Uber said that its drivers do not offer the service on a regular basis.

A senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Freeman said that the US Congress has a crucial role to play in stabilizing the US-China relationship. \u201cThere are few examples in history where a de facto superpower like the US faced a rising power like China and did not enter into direct conflict,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cGlossing over disagreements and competing interests is thus not an option for policymakers,\u201d he said. \u201cChina is not the Soviet Union and the US is trying neither to contain China nor begin a new Cold War.\u201d However, Freeman said that other Asia-Pacific nations \u2014 trying to avoid being bullied by a rising China \u2014 are drawing the US into a potentially hostile military posture with China.

The US Congress will \u201cinvariably\u201d be drawn into the debate on arms sales and it will be important for policymakers to understand and weigh in on what arms package will contribute to stability across the Taiwan Strait.

They said the Wuhan University-based unit is actually the Sixth Bureau of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department\u2019s (GSD) Third Department. The Sixth Bureau is engaged in technical aspects of surveillance and intelligence-gathering on important Taiwanese agencies, intercepting telecommunications signals, hacking computers and mobile phone service networks, and satellite imagery reconnaissance against Taiwan, according to recent statements and interviews with Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) and Ministry of National Defense (MND) officials. \u201cChina\u2019s espionage activities and intelligence-gathering against Taiwan and other countries is always hidden under the guise of academic research centers, non-profit foundations or private sector companies,\u201d said a ministry official who declined to be named. \u201cIt is the same for the PLA\u2019s GSD Sixth Bureau. Its units have network specialists, computer technicians, analysts and trained hackers working in offices at Wuhan University,\u201d he said. \u201cThese offices are installed on campus under the cover of research centers and telecommunication laboratories,\u201d he said. Other nations who have come under cyberattack and digital information theft have also reported that Chinese cyberarmy units are operating inside university campuses. \u201cThe aim is to conduct state espionage work under the facade of academic research,\u201d the defense ministry official said. Foreign and Taiwanese defense experts said the Sixth Bureau is one of the 12 bureaus under the PLA\u2019s GSD Third Department (abbreviated as \u201c3PLA\u201d), whose mandates and functions fall under the framework of technical reconnaissance and digital information warfare. PLA Unit 61398 in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong District, believed to be responsible for the hacking and theft of business information as well as designing malware attacks against the US and other Western countries, is part of the same agency network under 3PLA\u2019s 2nd Bureau. The unit gained widespread attention after the US Department of Justice on May 19 last year indicted five PLA officers with conducting economic cyberespionage against US companies, including Westinghouse Electric, US Steel, Allegheny Technologies and Alcoa, as well as the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union. The five men were identified as working for Unit 61398. Figures compiled by the National Security Bureau and other government departments in Taiwan show that in 2013, the NSB came under Chinese cyberwarfare attack 7.22 million times, the Ministry of Justice\u2019s Investigation Bureau (MJIB) came under 1.56 million cyberattacks and the defense ministry faced 1.01 million attacks. According to a senior MIB officer, China\u2019s surveillance and espionage activities against Taiwan can be divided into two main areas: human intelligence and signals intelligence. The human intelligence programs against Taiwan are mostly directed by its Ministry of State Security (also known as guoan, 國安部), along with the United Work Front Department, which is part of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee, the MIB officer said.","source":"taiwan","title":"PLA cyberunit targeting Taiwan named","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/03/10/2003613206"},"time":{"from":"2015-03-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Leading Taiwanese academics along with former colleagues, friends and students gathered over the weekend to commemorate the late Chang Yen-hsien (張炎憲), former Academia Historica president and head of the Taiwan Society, marking the occasion by publishing an anthology of tribute articles on Chang and his work. \u201cChang\u2019s whole life was devoted to elucidating and documenting Taiwan\u2019s history. He is the divine messenger sent by heaven to deliver to us the Taiwanese people\u2019s authentic history,\u201d law professor Lee Hung-hsi (李鴻禧) said. National Chengchu University historian Tai Pao-tsun (戴寶村) served as chief editor of the anthology, which was published by the Wu San Lien Foundation for Taiwan Historical Materials. Running to 565 pages, the collection contains contributions from renowned public figures, academics, colleagues, family members and Chang\u2019s former students \u2014 many of whom have become teachers, researchers and professors of Taiwanese culture, sociology and history. At a commemoration on Saturday, Tai said he titled the anthology: Documenting History to Build Up the Taiwan Nation (治史起造台灣國), because that had become Chang\u2019s life mission, with his tireless fieldwork talking to people, recording countless oral history interviews, enriching the research database and gradually cultivating a Taiwanese national identity. Close friends of Chang\u2019s, Lee and Tai were overcome with emotion and choked up when delivering eulogies and tributes during the commemoration. \u2018OUTSTANDING\u2019 \u201cChang was an outstanding history researcher. He represented the conscience of Taiwanese history in academic circles. He held strong to the principle of elucidating and documenting Taiwan\u2019s history based on the collective experiences and perspectives of Taiwanese people,\u201d former president Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) wrote in an article included in the anthology. Throughout his eight years at the helm of Academia Historica, Chang bravely broke the shackles of the past and led the institution into research on Taiwanese history that was mostly ignored by the government and society, the former president wrote. \u201cChang always espoused his conviction that study of Taiwan\u2019s history must be based on Taiwanese culture and identity, and not from the Chinese people\u2019s perspective. He opened the door and allowed Taiwanese to know our own history. From these efforts, the collective Taiwanese identity was gradually built up,\u201d Lee wrote. Dubbed the \u201cGreat Taiwan Historian\u201d by colleagues, Chang was also active in civic affairs, Taiwan\u2019s democracy movement and the struggle for freedom and civil rights. RANGE OF SERVICE Besides leading Academia Historica, Chang also held directorship and chairman posts in the Taiwan Society, the Taiwan Historic Research Association, the Taiwan Association of University Professors and other important academic and civic affairs organizations. Defying political pressure and interference from the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government, Chang undertook seminal research projects on the 228 Massacre, recording interviews with survivors and victims\u2019 families, and also on the history of the White Terror and Martial Law eras under the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s (蔣介石) family rule. Chang died after a heart attack in the US in October last year during a research trip aimed at recording interviews with Taiwanese expatriates \u2014 some of whom had been on a KMT blacklist for decades \u2014 about their struggles for Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom.","source":"taiwan","title":"Event honors \u2018Great Taiwan Historian\u2019","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/03/10/2003613220"},"time":{"from":"2015-03-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Taiwan Ship Carrying 49 Crew Missing in South Atlantic","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taiwan-ship-carrying-49-crew-missing-in-south-atlantic-744990"},"time":{"from":"2015-03-08","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"US President Barack Obama should sell advanced new weapons to Taiwan if China tries to take over another reef in the South China Sea, according to a Washington defense expert. \u201cWashington must begin to craft some sort of organized and coherent strategy when it comes to China \u2014 and not one that focuses on trade or profits, but [that] ensures there will be costs for its coercive actions,\u201d Center for the National Interest senior fellow for defense policy Harry Kazianis wrote in an article published on the Real Clear Defense Web site, where he serves as an editor. Any non-kinetic move China makes to undo the \u201cstatus quo\u201d in Asia should be met with a move of equal significance that reinforces US allies and partners\u2019 military capabilities, Kazianis wrote. Kazianis, also a senior fellow at the China Policy Institute, said that if Beijing tries to take over another reef in the South China Sea, Washington should decide that it is time to sell Taiwan F-16C/D aircraft. At the same time, Obama should help Taipei advance its domestic submarine program and \u201cfloat the idea\u201d that Taipei could receive the F-35 warplane, he wrote. \u201cThe strategy is simple: China moves to solidify its position in one area, we could counter with our allies and partners in another,\u201d Kazianis wrote. Such a strategy need not adopt the same \u201cbullying or confrontational\u201d tone that Beijing has employed, he said.

It turns out that the clip is about how the Japanese colonial government had once seriously entertained the idea of selling Taiwan, which it obtained after the First Sino-Japanese War, to France. Taiwan Bar, which is how the maker of the video refers to itself, has since released at least six episodes and mini-episodes on Taiwan\u2019s history, all focused on the Japanese colonial period. When asked why Taiwanese history, and the Japanese-governed era in particular, was picked as the theme, Taiwan Bar CEO DJ Hauer (謝政豪) said without hesitation: \u201cIt sells.\u201d \u201cThe social atmosphere after the student-led Sunflower movement in March last year told us that there is an audience for Taiwan\u2019s history,\u201d he added. \u201cOf course we have also been prompted by the idea of making a social contribution. However, we are not an issue-fixed social group; we are a for-profit company,\u201d Hauer said. The use of animation, is also aimed at turning a profit, he said. \u201cCharacters can be designed and licensed; they can make cross-over appearances in other series too,\u201d he said. In the Taiwanese history series, three cartoon characters were inspired by the Formosan bear, the Taiwanese blue magpie and the Formosan landlocked salmon. The bear, nicknamed \u201cblack beer\u201d (黑啤), has been made into a stuffed toy and is sold as one of the company\u2019s branded products. The Taiwan Bar team, now consisting of 15 members, began its first project on Taiwanese history with four founders \u2014 all in their twenties \u2014 as contributors: Hauer as producer; high-school history teacher Thomas Xiao (蕭宇辰); JiaJiach (張佳家), an animator whose specialty is graphic design and illustration; and narrator Buchi (林辰), who made his own videos on social discourse before joining the team. The Taiwan history project has four more episodes planned on post-war Taiwan, including the White Terror era, before it ends, but the company already has plans for more projects. The team recently aired an animated short introducing Dihua Street (迪化街) and its history as Taipei\u2019s famous \u201cboulevard of Lunar New Year products\u201d under a series titled Story Taipei. It is a project sponsored by the Taipei City Government. \u201cThey first came to us with the idea of making a promotional video solely for the street, as the Lunar New Year was approaching. However, I asked for a whole project that would include Taipei\u2019s other commercial districts,\u201d Hauer said. A full project would be better for city promotion and cost-efficiency, as the cost of convening a team for the production would be marginalized and newly designed characters could be better cultivated in a complete project consisting of many episodes, he said.

Rick Fisher, a senior fellow on Asian military affairs at the International Assessment and Strategy Center in Alexandria, Virginia, was commenting on a report on China\u2019s progress in space technologies released on Monday by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. The report by the University of California Institute on Global Conflict describes China\u2019s advancing space capabilities and was the subject of a news report in the Taipei Times yesterday. Chinese military analysts believe that space-based information systems will be a deciding factor in future wars and space will be a dominant battlefield, the report said. Fisher said that China now has the ability to target Taiwan\u2019s satellites in low Earth orbits. However, China\u2019s fundamental space threat to the nation comes from its potential to delay or prevent the US and other countries from aiding Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, he said. \u201cBy targeting key communication, surveillance and navigation satellites, China can make a US rescue mission far more difficult and costly to achieve,\u201d Fisher said. He said that space warfare capabilities could be useful in helping to achieve many Chinese objectives. \u201cChina\u2019s leadership understands that in order to ensure the success of its military endeavors on Earth, it has to control the high ground of space,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThey also understand this pursuit does not end at low Earth orbit, but must continue to the moon and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cChinese officials are already indicating that China\u2019s projection to the moon and deep space will be dual use, or used to enhance the power of the People\u2019s Liberation Army [PLA],\u201d he said. The report said that an earlier study established that China could image Taiwanese targets 35 times per day and that the PLA could use this capability to enable aircraft and missiles to pinpoint their fire, restrike targets or verify a target\u2019s destruction.

Starting next year, supervision of factories planning expansions will be tighter, including demands for data on possible increases in particles 2.5 microns or smaller in diameter (PM2.5), the EPA said. PM2.5 particles are considered particularly dangerous, because they are usually made up of substances like heavy metals that are more toxic and can travel deeper into the lungs when inhaled than larger particulates. In addition, the new regulations would examine emissions at maximum levels instead of at average levels to guard public health more thoroughly, the EPA said. Different PM2.5 control regions will also be set up, based on data collected by the administration over the past three years, EPA Department of Air Quality Protection section chief Huang Wei-ming (黃偉鳴) said. The west of the nation, prone to air pollution due to cold air masses from China often carrying pollutants across the Taiwan Strait, is likely to be the top control area in a three-tier system, he said.

Chiang statues have been defaced by graffiti, egg-throwing and even head-chopping over the past few days. Although such acts have occurred for years, they have apparently intensified over the week that culminated with the 228 Peace Memorial Day holiday on Saturday. Tsai, who just survived a recall vote on Feb. 14, posted a note on Facebook titled: \u201cThe historical paradox concerning Chiang Kai-shek.\u201d \u201cIt seems that Feb. 28 is a day on which a bunch of people show their hatred against Chiang, whose statues have been graffitied and disposed of,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cBut the paradoxical historical truth is that, if Taiwan had not been influenced by Chiang Kai-shek, there would not be a chance to even mention the 228 Incident.\u201d Without Chiang, Taiwan would have been part of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and \u201c\u2018one country, two systems\u2019 would have been a non-starter,\u201d Tsai said. He then listed figures and events that \u201cwould not have occured,\u201d including former presidents Chiang Ching-kuo (蔣經國) and Lee Teng-hui (李登輝), the KMT, the Democratic Progressive Party, former president Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁), President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) and the Sunflower movement. Those would have been replaced by Mao Zedong\u2019s (毛澤東) Great Leap Forward, the Great Hunger, the Cultural Revolution and its Red Guards, and Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s (習近平) Chinese Dream, he added.

With police ubiquitous near entrances and barbed wire ringing park walls, a solemn crowd of several hundred gathered in front of the 228 Memorial Monument, with most participants quietly holding up white chrysanthemums to symbolize mourning for the 228 victims. Strong political symbolism infused the service, which was conducted in Hoklo (commonly known as Taiwanese) and attended by many prominent pan-green politicians. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a little more than 20 years since authoritarian rule ended in Taiwan, and we have yet to achieve complete success in transitional justice and locally oriented education, as well as our efforts in seeking fairness and justice, and we\u2019re often met with challenges from conservatives,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cI would like to promise all of you here that if the DPP has another chance to be in power, we will face these challenges bravely, seriously pushing for transitional justice, democratic education and social justice, so that democracy in Taiwan will be more progressive and strong, so that more young people will have the opportunity to be more familiar with Taiwan, and to have a better understanding of our past,\u201d she added. \u201cEach one of us Taiwanese has a mission: We should put an end to all mistakes in history and, for generations to come, we will make Taiwan an authentically free and democratic country,\u201d she said.

The YouBike systems in Taipei, New Taipei City, Taichung and Changhua were still down as of 3:30pm, and the company said its engineers were working with telecoms to fix the problem. Users were able to return their rented bikes, but could not check out bikes. YouBike spokesperson Liu Li-chu (劉麗珠) attributed the problem to a huge volume of Internet traffic which began overwhelming the YouBike system at about 10am. Soon after the system went down, the company urged users to use other forms of transport to get to their destination.

The plan for the adjusted toll rates is to be forwarded to Minister of Transportation and Communications Chen Jian-yu (陳建宇) next week and trial runs will be implemented later this year, the bureau said. The idea is to charge a higher toll rate during peak hours and a lower rate in off-peak hours, the bureau said. The specific fees and the definition of peak and off-peak hours vary depending on the type of holiday, it added.

The council on Tuesday said that 1,428 students \u2014 mostly ethnic Chinese students from Southeast Asian nations \u2014 successfully applied for work permits over the past six months. Although up to 5,000 foreign students obtain Taiwanese higher-education degrees each year, in the past, an average of only 850 foreign students per year stayed to work. The reforms have been enacted in a bid to revitalize the nation\u2019s shrinking workforce and attract foreign talent, the council said. Recent statistics released by the Ministry of Labor show that the workforce is decreasing by 180,000 people per year, as the result of an aging society. The increase in employment among foreign students was largely a result of reforms that broaden the criteria for work permits among foreign students, the council said. Instead of the previous fixed-wage requirement that meant foreign students had to earn a minimum of NT$37,619 a month, a new evaluation system enacted in July last year by the Ministry of Labor considers eight factors. The new measure benefits foreign students who earn less than the monthly minimum, but perform strongly in other criteria \u2014 including Chinese-language ability, foreign-language ability, education level, work experience, professional qualifications and experience living abroad \u2014 as well as additional bonuses for those who seek employment in select industries. Among the successful applicants in the past six months, the average monthly wage was NT$34,863, with more than half employed in the information technology or mechanical engineering industries, the council said. Lai Jia-jen (賴家仁), head of the labor ministry\u2019s Foreign Labor Management Division, yesterday said that depending on the success of the reforms, the evaluation system for foreign students could act as a precursor to attract additional foreign talent. \u201cWe will take into consideration the results of these trial evaluations for foreign students, and consider formulating a similar mechanism for foreign professionals,\u201d Lai said. Currently, foreign professionals without Taiwanese degrees must earn a minimum of NT$47,971 a month to qualify for a work permit, while those without a master\u2019s degree usually require at least two years of work experience. A related council project announced last month, Headstart Taiwan, stipulates relaxed regulations for foreigners who wish to work at select startup companies that fulfill government qualifications, to attract foreign talent and boost entrepreneurship in Taiwan.

However, NCC spokesperson Yu Hsiao-cheng (虞孝成) said further punishments were likely, as the commission plans to address other telecommunication regulation violations committed by Asia Pacific.

Founded in 1981, the foundation helps burn survivors and people with facial disfigurement with their physical, psychological and social rehabilitation. Last year, it aided 1,398 families, more than half of whom experienced financial hardship after their main income earners lost jobs because of facial disfigurement. About 70 percent of disfigured people cannot find work because of their appearance, the foundation said.

The protesters gathered in front of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) office before marching to the Presidential Office Building and ending their action late in the afternoon. Organizers said they were demonstrating against cross-strait talks between MAC Minister Wang Yu-chi (王郁琦) and Chinese Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) Minister Zhang Zhijun (張志軍), as the event was to begin yesterday, but was canceled in an announcement on Thursday. The activists handed a letter to the council demanding that before the resumption of cross-strait talks, China must remove all the missiles it has aimed at Taiwan, and that the Chinese government renounce the threat of military attack against Taiwan. Headed by the Taiwanese National Party (TNP, 台灣民族黨), the protesters also included members from the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign, Taiwanese National Congress and the Taiwan Independence Association. \u201cWe are here to stop the government from signing any secret deal with China.

Others were arrested for participating in the demonstration. Still we come here today to tell Zhang that he is not welcome, and that Taiwanese people must stand up to China\u2019s threat,\u201d he said. The MAC said that the meeting was canceled due to both sides needing to deal with events concerning Wednesday\u2019s crash of TransAsia Airways Flight GE235. Another reason for the cancellation, according to the MAC, was that both sides still had disagreements over China\u2019s newly drawn flight routes that run close to the median line of the Taiwan Strait.","source":"taiwan","title":"Pro-Taiwan groups protest against cross-strait talks","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/02/08/2003611087"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-08","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"A US defense expert is urging Japan to sell Soryu-class submarines equipped with US communications and weapons systems to Taiwan. \u201cWashington should make Taiwan\u2019s submarine program a priority for the bilateral security relationship,\u201d American Enterprise Institute defense policy analyst Michael Mazza said. In a study published this week by institute, Mazza said US President Barack Obama\u2019s administration should directly inform Beijing that it views China\u2019s military modernization \u201cwith great concern.\u201d He said the nature of the buildup makes it a central national security concern for the US. The buildup, Mazza said, is largely focused on enabling the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army to defeat the US military in battle, to subjugate democratic neighbors like Taiwan and to deny the US free access to the Western Pacific and Asian waters. \u201cChinese military modernization threatens to undermine an Asian order that has been key to prosperity and security in both Asia and the US,\u201d he said. Mazza said he believes China is threatening the peace in the South China Sea on which US economic and security interests depend. In the East China Sea, Mazza said, China is showing a \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the maintenance of peace and is challenging the US\u2019 most important regional alliance. Mazza said the US must adopt a more robust regional posture and contain the Chinese military within the first island chain. \u201cDoing so will minimize the Chinese military\u2019s ability to pose a direct threat to the US and effectively threaten the US\u2019 allies,\u201d he said. Mazza made the case for two strategies in particular that he considers worth pursuing. First, he said that US partners South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and India all want to upgrade their submarine fleets. US strategists, Mazza said, should consider the value of an allied submarine \u201cpicket line\u201d that would allow for enhanced tracking of Chinese subs exiting and re-entering the South China Sea, and position the allies to more easily close strategic chokepoints in the event of conflict. \u201cPartner nations could divide geographic responsibilities, with Taiwan taking primary responsibility for patrolling waters in and around the Taiwan Strait and the US doing so in the South China Sea itself,\u201d he said. To encourage greater interoperability, Mazza said the US should support Japan\u2019s efforts to sell its submarines abroad and lobby for US industrial participation in indigenous submarine programs. In particular, he said, Washington should assist Taiwan with its indigenous production plans or push Tokyo to sell Soryu-class submarines to Taipei. \u201cWhere direct cooperation might be too sensitive \u2014 between Southeast Asians and Taiwan for example \u2014 the US can abet implicit coordination,\u201d Mazza said. Mazza\u2019s study followed testimony by US Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall before a hearing of the US House Armed Services Committee that China\u2019s military modernization had undermined US superiority. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk and the situation is getting worse,\u201d Kendall said. Earlier this week, the former intelligence chief of the US Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet, Captain James Fanell, said in Honolulu that Beijing was \u201crejuvenating\u201d and preparing for a military conflict. \u201cChina\u2019s rise, if left unchecked or undeterred, will necessarily disrupt the peace and stability of our friends, partners and allies,\u201d Fanell told the Washington Free Beacon Web site.","source":"taiwan","title":"US analyst urges Japan to sell Taiwan submarines","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/02/07/2003611010"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"DIPLOMACY US official to visit The managing director of the American Institute in Taiwan\u2019s (AIT) Washington office is to visit to discuss issues related to the relationship between the two nations, the institute said yesterday.

TOURISM Alishan shuttle announced Visitors to the Alishan National Scenic Area will have the option of taking a free shuttle service to the park from pick-up points along the closest highway during the Lunar New Year period, the Forestry Bureau said earlier this week. From Feb. 19 to Feb. 23, the service will run between a designated section of Provincial Highway No. 18 and the main entrance to the Alishan scenic area, said the Chiayi Forest District Office, which manages the area. The service is being offered in an effort to reduce traffic congestion during the Lunar New Year holidays, when visitors usually flock to Alishan mainly to see its cherry trees in full bloom, the office said. There will be seven pick-up stops along the route and temporary parking areas will be designated near each stop, the office said, adding that parking space at the entrance to the scenic area is limited. At the main entrance to the area, 200 parking spaces will be allocated for scooters and motorcycles during the Lunar New Year period, but they will not be allowed into the actual preserve, the office said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/02/07/2003611020"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Both TransAsia plane engines lost power before Taiwan crash","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Both-TransAsia-plane-engines-lost-power-before-Taiwan-crash/articleshow/46154065.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Taiwan Plane Black Boxes Reveal Attempts to Regain Thrust","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taiwan-plane-black-boxes-reveal-attempts-to-regain-thrust-737500"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-06","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Taiwan Pilot Called 'Mayday' to Announce Engine Flameout","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taiwan-pilot-called-mayday-to-announce-engine-flameout-737445"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-06","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"The US will help in any way it can with the investigation into the crash of TransAsia Flight GE235, a Washington official said on Wednesday.

In 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 \u2014 a Boeing 737-200 \u2014 ploughed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River in Washington, shortly after take-off from the then-National Airport. Freezing temperatures and ice slowed the flight on take-off and once airborne, it could not reach sufficient speed and altitude to fly. After hitting the bridge, the plane plummeted into the river. Of the 74 passengers and five crew members on board, only four passengers and one flight attendant survived. Four motorists on the bridge were also killed. The US National Transportation Safety Board determined that pilot error was responsible for the crash. In 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 \u2014 an Airbus A320-200 \u2014 hit a flock of geese on take-off from New York City\u2019s LaGuardia Airport.

TRAVEL MOFA issues warnings The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is urging Taiwanese to avoid travel to several states in Myanmar because of clashes between government forces and ethnic minorities. The ministry raised the travel alert to \u201corange\u201d for the states of Kachin, Shan, Kayin and Mon, after tensions heightened between the military and armed groups affiliated with ethnic minorities. The ministry also urged Taiwanese to avoid travel to Mindanao in the Philippines because of clashes between the government and anti-government militants. Last week, Philippine police came under attack in Maguindanao Province by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. In light of the fighting and the occasional abduction of foreigners by militants, the ministry said it would keep the travel alert for Mindanao at \u201corange.\u201d ENTERTAINMENT Katy Perry to perform US pop superstar Katy Perry is set to give her first performance in the nation in April.

The nation\u2019s declining birthrate \u2014 one of the lowest in the world, the low participation rate of middle-aged workers and a continued outflow of skilled personnel are contributing to demographic changes that mean each senior citizen is supported by just 1.2 working-age people, the council\u2019s statistics show. The current labor force \u2014 which is defined as people aged 15 to 64 \u2014 makes up 74 percent of the nation\u2019s 23.37 million people, while seniors aged 65 and over account for 12 percent. However, the council estimates that the elderly population will more than triple before 2061 \u2014 to 38 percent of the total \u2014 and the workforce will drop to half of the population. At present, each senior citizen has the support of 6.2 working-age people, but that will plummet to 1.2 over the next 44 years, the council said. Council labor specialist Hsieh Chia-yi (謝佳宜) said another trend is for young people to delay their entry to the labor force by extending their studies, even as more middle-aged workers retire relatively early. The labor market\u2019s problem is worsened by the outflow of highly skilled workers seeking opportunities abroad while Taiwan attracts mostly only basic-level laborers, Hsieh said. The central government hopes to help remedy the problems by boosting the total labor participation from the current 58 percent to 60 percent in 2020 and encouraging more women to work to raise their percentage of workers from 50 percent to 53 percent, Hsieh said. However, these measures alone might not be enough to hold off the clouds over Taiwan\u2019s demographic makeup. Other initiatives include diversifying the job market while trying to convince young people to get a job before seeking a master\u2019s degree, which Hsieh said could help resolve the problem of advanced degree holders who lack real workplace experience. The council has also talked about creating \u201cfriendly work environments\u201d to entice Taiwanese to return from abroad, though it did not provide specific measures. National Development Council Deputy Minister Kao Shien-quey (高仙桂) advocates more flexible hours, including flexible vacation time, to encourage women to return to the workforce after having children. Whatever measures it adopts, the council will have its work cut out, as the nation moves closer to becoming an aged society \u2014 a point that could come as early as next year. The population is expected to peak at 32.5 million or 23.6 million between 2019 and 2026, and Taiwan could become a \u201csuper-aged\u201d society in which the elderly make up 20 percent by 2025, council estimates show. The council has recommended developing \u201csmart\u201d industries based on automation to reduce the reliance on a shrinking labor force and keep the nation\u2019s manufacturing dominated economy running even without people at the helm.","source":"taiwan","title":"Worker numbers drop as Taiwan ages, council says","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/02/02/2003610641"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-02","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"DEVELOPMENT Donations praised by WTO The WTO has praised Taiwan\u2019s donations to programs aimed at helping emerging countries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday. In a statement issued on Jan. 21, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo welcomed Taiwan\u2019s contributions and said they were playing a role in helping developing and countries strengthen their links with world markets, the ministry said. Azevedo was referring to a memorandum of understanding Taiwan signed with the WTO Secretariat to donate US$80,000 a year for three years from last year to next year to a plant and animal health initiative through the WTO\u2019s Standards and Trade Development Facility. The agreement, which the ministry said underscores Taiwan\u2019s support for the development of a multilateral trade system, helps developing countries build their capacity to implement international sanitary and phytosanitary measures. DEFENSE Radar disruption alleged A new aerial listening station set up by China in its coastal Fujian Province appears to be aimed at disrupting Taiwan\u2019s PAVE PAWS early-warning radar system, according to a report by Canada-based monthly Kanwa Defense Review. The new base in Huian is equipped with a phased array radar that is pointed directly at Taiwan\u2019s PAVE PAWS in Hsinchu, just 240km away across the Taiwan Strait, the magazine said. Kanwa founder and editor-in-chief Andrei Chang (張毅弘) said the deployment is part of China\u2019s plan to monitor, record, analyze and disrupt PAVE PAWS signals. Japanese defense technology analyst Tomohiko Tada agreed with Chang\u2019s analysis, saying that because the phased array radar in Huian is very close to Taiwan\u2019s PAVE PAWS, it can cause intermittent disruption to the system by intentionally using the same wave band, Tada said. However, China is unlikely to completely disrupt or paralyze the PAVE PAWS, he added. TRADE US APEC official to visit Senior US APEC official Robert Wang (王曉岷) is set to visit Taiwan to discuss trade and economic issues, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said yesterday. During his visit from Saturday to Tuesday next week, Wang is to \u201cmeet with Taiwan officials and business leaders to exchange views on this year\u2019s APEC agenda and other trade and economic matters of mutual concern,\u201d the AIT said.

The daily quota for Chinese group tourists is 5,000 people per day, and the additional 500 visas will only be available for groups going to the outlying islands who follow the Taiwan Strait Tourism Association\u2019s guidelines for accommodation, itineraries and shopping arrangements. The new policy will be in effect for one year as part of a trial project by the bureau to boost tourism on the islands, the association said. The association, along with China\u2019s Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange, is responsible for handling cross-strait tourism issues.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/01/28/2003610278"},"time":{"from":"2015-01-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"IMMIGRATION Detention rules updated The legislature on Friday approved an amendment to the Immigration Act (入出國及移民法) that limits the temporary detention of foreign nationals to no more than 15 days.

FINE ARTS Violinist wins abroad Young Taiwanese violinist Tseng Yu-chien (曾宇謙) took first prize in the first Singapore International Violin Competition on Wednesday last week. Second-prize winner Richard Lin (林品任) is also from Taiwan, while third prize went to Sirena Huang, a US citizen of Taiwanese descent. Tseng described the competition as a rare experience and said he was very happy to be named champion. The triennial competition is hosted by the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music at National University of Singapore and is open to talented violinists under the age of 30.

DISABILITY ACCESS Eateries now \u2018barrier-free\u2019 As many as 1,000 restaurants in Taipei, Hsinchu City and Greater Tainan have been recognized as disabled-friendly after a campaign to promote barrier-free living, the League of Welfare Organizations for the Disabled said. The barrier-free living movement was launched in Taipei in 2012, expanding to Greater Tainan in 2013 and to Hsinchu last year, the league said. Disabled people were recruited to examine restaurants to see whether they are friendly toward people who need help, including disabled people, senior citizens, pregnant women and parents with young children, it said. The league worked with Taipei to create a certification system for eateries that improve access. Smartphone apps allow users to search for such restaurants in Taipei and Hsinchu, the league said. FOOD SAFETY Ting Hsin cash rejected The government will not accept a NT$3 billion (US$95.69 million) donation offered by Ting Hsin International Group to promote food safety, Minister of Health Chiang Been-huang (蔣丙煌) said yesterday. Chiang said the conglomerate should first compensate food makers and consumers affected by its substandard oil products. Ting Hsin has become the target of consumer boycotts since October last year, when it was selling cooking oils mixed with animal feed-grade fats. At the suggestion of Ruentex Group chairman Samuel Yin (尹衍樑), Ting Hsin pledged to donate NT$3 billion to fund a food safety reform committee, intended to be led by Yin himself. Yin later proposed that Ting Hsin donate the money to the Ministry of Health and Welfare instead to help the government improve food safety. Ting Hsin on Friday remitted the funds from overseas to the government. Ting Hsin said it respects the government\u2019s decision to reject the money, but added that it is determined to promote food safety and will not change its plan.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/01/25/2003610048"},"time":{"from":"2015-01-25","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"ENVIRONMENT US officials arrive for talks Two US officials arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a four-day trip to discuss international fisheries and marine conservation, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said on Thursday.

However, Cha said that Taiwan had worked very hard to bring itself to the table \u201cin all sorts of different international institutions\u201d and \u201cyou can\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d \u201cIf in the long term TPP has a sort of transformational effect on not just the economic, but also the strategic picture, and if the cross-strait relationship continues to improve, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s possible in the future,\u201d he said. Organized by the Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) and the Asian Studies Program at Georgetown University, the conference was focused on negotiating growth in Asia.

An academic paper on cross-strait relations published by the CSIS this week says that Taiwan continues to be \u201ceffectively excluded\u201d from regional trade regimes such as the TPP and bilateral trade liberalization agreements. Written by David Brown, a Johns Hopkins University professor of China studies, and Kevin Scott, an associate director of Asian policy studies at the Brookings Institution, the paper says that in October last year, then-minister of economic affairs Woody Duh (杜紫軍) said several other countries were willing to hold substantive trade negotiations with Taiwan, but that talks had not begun due to interference from China. \u201cThe hesitant countries are believed to be India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia and perhaps Australia,\u201d the paper says.

Since the latest avian flu outbreak was first reported last week, three new strains, including variants of H5N2 and H5N8, have been discovered. As of 6pm on Thursday, 137 poultry farms have been inspected and samples have been collected for laboratory testing. The latest results showed that 101 of the farms were infected, with the H5N3 virus found at two of them, the bureau said. All three newly found strains are highly pathogenic, the bureau said. H5N3 was found in samples from two geese farms in Greater Kaohsiung and Pingtung County, and it was apparently responsible for the deaths of 53 geese at the latter. Animal Health Research Institute Director-General Tsai Hsiang-jung (蔡向榮) said the new sub-type of H5N3 is the result of a viral recombination, just like the new variant H5N2 found on Sunday last week. The \u201cH5\u201d (hemagglutinin) of the local H5N3 subtype is 99 percent the same as one seen in South Korea, while the \u201cN3\u201d (neuraminidase) is 98 percent similar to the H1N3 found in Thai ducks in 2011, the H2N3 found in Mongolian mallards in 2010 and the H5N3 found in wild ducks in Kaohsiung in 2013, Tsai said. The N3 is also 97 percent identical to the H5N3 found in domestic ducks in Hualien County in 2013, the expert added. \u201cIt is certain this is the first time the [new sub-type of] H5N3 was detected in geese raised at farms in Taiwan,\u201d Tsai said, adding that he suspects the outbreak is not the first of its kind in the world, but would have to check relevant data to be sure. Like the new variant of H5N2 and H5N8, H5N3 is \u201chighly pathogenic and deadly\u201d for the birds. National Chung Hsing University professor of veterinary medicine H.K. Shieh (謝快樂) said that as ducks and geese raised in open fields have been hit the hardest by the outbreaks, he believes the viruses are being spread by wild birds coming in contact with farm flocks. He suggested the recombination that created the new sub-types might have happened in regions to the north of Taiwan such as Siberia and then was brought here. While so far only ducks and geese have been killed by the avian flu virus strains, the outbreak would be deadly for chickens should it come in contact with the largest domestic poultry group in Taiwan, Shieh said. According to Tsai, one chicken egg farm in Pingtung and another in Greater Tainan have been confirmed to be infected with a previously known strain of H5N2, which is also highly pathogenic. Another chicken farm in Changhua County has been confirmed to be infected with an H5 subtype, but the exact subtype has not been completely identified, Tsai said. A chicken farm in Miaoli County, where 80 out of 15,080 chickens have died, might also be infected, Tsai said, adding that laboratory testing has taken place and it is to take two weeks before results are known. Of the 137 farms where samples have been collected for testing, 124 are goose farms. The farms are home to 424,641 geese, or 23.99 percent of all geese in the nation, according to the bureau. As of yesterday, the price for goose meat remained unchanged at NT$62 per 600 grams despite the outbreak, the council said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Third bird flu strain hits Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/01/17/2003609457"},"time":{"from":"2015-01-17","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"ENTERTAINMENT \u2018Panda\u2019 awards taking votes Taipei Zoo is asking netizens to show their support for young giant panda Yuan Zai (圓仔) and one of its keepers, both of whom are in the running for two Giant Panda Zoo Awards, an online prize dedicated to panda conservation.

Nationwide there were 1,643 new HIV/AIDS patients in 2009, down from 1,739 in 2008. The CDC said most patients contracted the disease from unprotected sex. WATERWAYS Liugongjun to flow again National Taiwan University said it plans to rejuvenate a 200-year-old waterway that crosses underneath the campus with water from the Xindian River and recycled rainwater. Part of the Liugongjun \u2014 a canal system that once ran across Taipei, but was mostly covered over by roads amid urbanization \u2014 will see sunlight again, Office of General Affairs dean Wang Gen-shuh (王根樹) said. The major hurdle that prevented the school from launching the project 10 years ago \u2014 a lack of a ready water source \u2014 could be solved with technology, he said. Plans for the project originally anticipated the need for more than 1,000 cubic meters of water per day, but new technology will limit the water\u2019s depth to 25cm and keep it flowing with only about 200 cubic meters of water a day, Wang said, adding that the waterway will be linked up to Drunken Moon Lake on campus. The program is expected to take three years to complete at a cost of NT$100 million (US$3.13 million), Wang said. HEALTH Haze leave up in air: official Whether the government should allow \u201chaze leave\u201d due to heavy air pollution needs discussion, Environmental Protection Administration Minister Wei Kuo-yen (魏國彥) said yesterday. Taiwan is easily affected by haze from China in winter due to strong northeasterly winds, Wei said. \u201cTaiwan should have a pre-warning system for air pollution, but the formulation of a haze leave system needs to be discussed,\u201d he said. Wei said the Ministry of Education has formulated criteria for class suspensions in elementary schools to allow children with asthma or allergy problems to receive special care when haze reaches serious levels, while the average child would only have to suspend outdoor activities. \u201cWhether adults should get haze leave and the criteria for such leave will need further discussion,\u201d he said.

He issued the warning after a report in Defense News said that by 2018, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) will have more phased-array radar-equipped destroyers than any regional competitor \u2014 including Japan and South Korea. The US-based magazine said that Beijing had commissioned its fifth Type 052C destroyer, the Jinan, on Dec. 22 last year, \u201cleaving one last ship of that type to be finished.\u201d The magazine said that the Chinese navy\u2019s procurement of Luyang-class Type 052C/Ds and Type 055 guided-missile cruisers with phased-array radars would provide long-range anti-aircraft warfare support to China\u2019s planned carrier strike groups. Fisher told the Taipei Times that the ships would be incorporated into anti-surface warfare groups that can use their long-range radar to help target long-range anti-ship ballistic missile strikes or cruise missile strikes from strike-fighters and bombers. \u201cTheir larger size and larger weapons compliment means they can conduct anti-aircraft and anti-submarine missions in support of aircraft carrier and amphibious assault groups,\u201d Fisher said. He added that the next class of destroyer China will build is the Type 055, which is expected to be an 11,800-tonne destroyer capable of carrying more than 100 missiles and which could also be the first Chinese warship to use energy weapons like lasers or railguns. \u201cChina\u2019s rapid buildup of these large powerful warships helps to justify Taiwan\u2019s requirement for submarines large enough to carry an adequate weapons payload of long-range anti-ship missiles and long-range torpedoes a significant distance from Taiwan,\u201d Fisher added. Echoing other defense experts, he said that a fleet of mini-submarines may not survive an offensive once they are at the distance from Taiwan proper they would have to be to engage the large Chinese warships. \u201cChina\u2019s large radar and missile ships also pose a grave threat to Taiwan\u2019s fleet of 12 P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft, again emphasizing Taiwan\u2019s requirement for larger submarines capable of anti-submarine missions,\u201d Fisher said. Defense News said that the new destroyers would serve as the PLAN\u2019s \u201cworkhorses,\u201d giving the navy more flexibility. In a Taiwan contingency, the vessels could provide area-wide defensive air coverage, \u201ccomplicating Taipei\u2019s ability to defend its airspace,\u201d the magazine added.","source":"taiwan","title":"China\u2019s buildup of modern warships a \u2018threat\u2019 to Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/01/11/2003608979"},"time":{"from":"2015-01-11","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Taiwan to Cull 120,000 Chickens After Bird Flu Outbreak","url":"http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/taiwan-to-cull-120-000-chickens-after-bird-flu-outbreak-725208"},"time":{"from":"2015-01-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"TOURISM Travel fair targets the public A travel fair targeting Taiwanese who plan to travel during the Lunar New Year holiday opened yesterday with the participation of some 200 exhibitors.

HEALTH Flu season starts The confirmed infection rate of influenza surged over the past week to 12.1 percent from 3.7 percent the week before, indicating flu season is approaching its peak, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday. Taiwan has officially entered flu season since the rate has surpassed the 10 percent threshold, meaning 10 out of every 100 patients with flu-like symptoms are confirmed to be infected, explained CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥). When the rate hits 20 percent, it means that the flu season has reached a peak, he added. According to Chuang, the dominant virus strain is Influenza A virus subtype H3N2, which is similar to the recent outbreak in the US. The CDC urged the public to get vaccinated as soon as possible because it takes about two weeks for the antibodies to develop in the body after vaccination. Senior citizens, young children and anyone with chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease or diabetes are at a higher risk of flu complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis and even death. CDC data showed 55 cases of severe flu-related complications since August last year, including 14 deaths among people with chronic conditions.

Published this month in Chinese, the book is Tchernegovski\u2019s love letter to Taiwan, the people of Alishan who helped him search for Reuben and the music of pop diva Jody Chiang (江蕙), whose songs he discovered on several trips to Chiayi over the past 15 years.

Meng is said to be the daughter of a high-ranking general of the PLA Fourth Field Army, which is headquartered in Guangzhou City, and is representing herself as a PLA-affiliated official. According to the Chinese-language Next Magazine, she entered Taiwan in September 2013 and has been in the country illegally for more than a year. NIA officials said they were not able to track her whereabouts. The Ministry of National Defense (MND) and the NIA have come in for criticism because the woman allegedly entertained guests with a theatrical performance of a certain \u201cPLA musical show\u201d at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, as well as at the Friends of Armed Forces Association Building, which is administered by the ministry. In a statement on Friday, the ministry acknowledged that its officials had been negligent and confirmed that Meng\u2019s \u201cPLA musical show\u201d had taken place at MND-administered facilities. \u201cWe have asked the Friends of Armed Forces Association to review its management and have requested all local facilities throughout Taiwan to improve the scrutiny of their guests, and to check up on the functions that rented venues are to be used for,\u201d the statement said. The ministry said that Meng\u2019s \u201cPLA musical show\u201d was booked by the \u201cChinese Women Party\u201d (中華婦女黨), which is a registered civic group. Meanwhile, an NIA spokesperson said the agency is investigating the case and making an effort to track down Meng, and would deport her once she has been located.","source":"taiwan","title":"Woman on alleged PLA campaign in Taiwan illegally","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/01/04/2003608441"},"time":{"from":"2015-01-04","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Taiwan must resume localization","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/01/03/2003608337"},"time":{"from":"2015-01-03","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"ASTRONOMY Quadrantids to peak Astronomy buffs may have a chance to spot shooting stars this weekend as the Quadrantid meteor shower reaches its peak, but they will need some luck, the Taipei Astronomical Museum said yesterday. As the Quadrantids are expected to peak at 10am tomorrow, the best time to see them is before dawn that day, the museum said. The museum cautioned that while 120 meteors per hour could flash through the sky from a radiant in the north, the near-full moon would make observation conditions less than ideal. Observers will be lucky to spot a few dozen shooting stars per hour this time, it said. The Quadrantid meteor shower was discovered in 1825 by Italian astronomers. By 1938, it was confirmed to be one of the three strongest annual meteor showers, the other two being the Perseids and the Geminids. The origin of the Quadrantids remains unclear, but the museum said the meteor shower is most likely debris from small body 2003 EH1.
