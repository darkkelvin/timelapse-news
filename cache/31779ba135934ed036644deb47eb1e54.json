The result represented a major leap for Taiwan, which finished 36th in 2013 and 11th last year in the annual index that measures how open governments are in providing key information. However, in a statement on this year\u2019s index, Open Knowledge International said that \u201csignificant progress is still to be made, as Taiwan\u2019s overall score reveals that their data is only 78 percent open.\u201d \u201cCrucial datasets such as government spending, postcodes and land ownership are still closed and inaccessible to citizens,\u201d the British non-profit organization said. Premier Mao Chi-kuo (毛治國) said that open data and value-added applications are an important strategy for promoting good governance, service innovation and overall economic development, and are a solid foundation for the government\u2019s Internet policy, called \u201cide@Taiwan.\u201d Under the policy, concrete goals and plans were drawn up for the nation to become fully digitized by 2020, according to the Executive Yuan. Rounding out the Open Data Index top 10 following Taiwan were the UK, Denmark, Colombia, Finland, Australia, Uruguay, the US, the Netherlands and Norway. The next-highest ranked countries in Asia were India at 19th, South Korea at 23rd and Singapore at 25th. While the top rankings remained dominated by OECD members, three non-OECD nations broke into the top 10 this year for the first time, Open Knowledge said, referring to Taiwan, Colombia and Uruguay. \u201cOverall, whilst there was meaningful improvement in the number of open datasets (from 124 to 154), the percentage of open datasets across all the surveyed countries fell from 11 percent in 2014 to 9 percent in 2015,\u201d the group said. \u201cIt is clear that little progress has been made at the global level.\u201d According to Open Knowledge, the index is the result of civil society collaboration to track the state of open data in countries and places around the world. The index ranks nations based on the availability and accessibility of data in 13 key categories, including national statistics, government budgets, government spending, legislation, election results, procurement tenders and national maps. Other categories are pollution emissions, weather forecasts, company registers, location datasets, water quality and land ownership.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan tops Global Open Data Index","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/12/10/2003634477"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"24.2225023","longtitude":"120.6545022","location":"China"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"China Chips Away at US, Taiwan Semiconductor Dominance","url":"http://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/china-chips-away-at-us-taiwan-semiconductor-dominance-775642"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-09","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"If the US does not pay more attention to the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait, it will be \u201cinviting a war,\u201d an expert on Asian military affairs said on Monday. \u201cOne side is already preparing for such a war,\u201d International Assessment and Strategy Center (IASC) senior fellow Richard Fisher said. He was addressing a Capitol Hill forum \u2014 attended by US Congressional staffers \u2014 on growing Chinese military threats to Taiwan. Fisher said that a central part of the \u201cChina dream\u201d was to become the world\u2019s dominant military power. He said that for Taiwan to deter a Chinese attack on the nation, the US would have to do much more than it is. A new generation of capability has to be made available, Fisher said. He said that China wants to exploit Taiwan and use it as a military base. According to Fisher \u201cthe pressure is going to be on\u201d by the early 2020s and Taipei\u2019s need for submarines was \u201cwithout argument.\u201d He said that Washington should provide fighters to replace Taiwan\u2019s aging French Dassault Mirage 2000s. \u201cIf they can\u2019t afford new F-16s, let us offer them used F-16s, or even a small number of F-35s, which are very expensive, but at least we could start training and building up capacity to a fifth-generation level,\u201d he said. Fisher said that energy weapons could be key to Taiwan\u2019s needs and that 100 railguns could probably \u201ctake down\u201d the bulk of a Chinese missile attack. \u201cIf the Chinese understood that, they wouldn\u2019t launch those missiles in the first place,\u201d he said. A Chinese invasion could look like \u201cthe reverse of Dunkirk\u201d Fisher said, referring to a major World War II evacuation of Allied troops from France. Beijing could probably transport eight to 12 divisions across the Taiwan Strait, he said. He said that China would use thousands of civilian-owned barges and ships. \u201cInstead of rescuing people, this \u2018Dunkirk\u2019 fleet is going to be the invasion force,\u201d he said. Arthur Waldron, a professor of international relations at the University of Pennsylvania, said that since 2009, China had become overbearing and militaristic. \u201cIn other words, she is dangerous,\u201d Waldron said. He said that China is threatening Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam and India. \u201cThat\u2019s an awful lot of countries to be threatening at one time,\u201d Waldron said. He added: \u201cChina fully intends to achieve her goal. She believes that in 10 years time, she is going to own the South China Sea; she is going to be the harbormaster.\u201d \u201cThe US has done nothing that actually slows progress towards this goal,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one has done anything to throw sand in the wheels.\u201d However, the nations under threat are not \u201cpotted plants\u201d he said. \u201cThey are reacting and they are beginning to rearm,\u201d Waldron said. He said that India is already a nuclear power and that others might also go nuclear to stop China. Waldron said the US needed to tell China that if it attacked Taiwan, there would be a strong reaction.

Maurice Poinsot, 83, began doing missionary work in Hualien County\u2019s Yuli Township (玉里) when he was 27 years old. He learned Mandarin, Hoklo (commonly known as Taiwanese), Hakka and Amis to assimilate into the communities. To help other priests learn the Amis language, Poinsot and now-deceased father Louis Pourrias began to compile an Amis-French dictionary, going to Amis villages to conduct research. The dictionary, which mainly records the Amis language in central Hualien and along the east coast, remains an important reference book for studying the Amis language, the ministry said. Huang Meei-jin (黃美金), a professor in the Department of Applied Foreign Languages at Shih Chien University, was also recognized for her efforts in preserving Aboriginal languages. HEALTH New dengue deaths reported Eleven new deaths caused by dengue hemorrhagic fever have taken the death toll to 195 since the outbreak began in May, the Central Epidemic Command Center said yesterday. Among the 11 was a 29-year-old man with cerebral palsy, the youngest person reported to have died from the disease so far this year, it said. The deaths were recorded over the past week in Kaohsiung. They involved six men and five women aged between 29 and 84, the center said, adding that another 24 deaths are being examined to determine whether they were also caused by the disease. CRIME Men arrested over batteries Police in Kaohsiung have arrested two men for allegedly importing fake iPhone batteries and cables from China, while officers raided stores in the southern city that were allegedly selling the products, authorities said yesterday. Acting on tips from the public, police conducted an investigation and searched several stores in Kaohsiung in October. They discovered more than 1,500 fake iPhone parts with a market value of NT$5 million (US$151,345), and arrested two suspects surnamed Lin and Lee. The suspects allegedly imported the fake batteries and cables from Chinese companies. The parts for iPhone 5, 5S and 6 models look almost the same as genuine ones and also came with fake serial number stickers, police said. The fake parts were sold at 80 percent of the price of genuine iPhone parts, police said. SOCIETY Weight-loss success touted More than 8,600 people in Chiayi City this year participated in an annual weight-loss program organized by the city\u2019s Bureau of Health, shedding a combined total of 16 tonnes, the bureau said on Monday. The program had a target of 9.5 tonnes, but the result far exceeded expectations, the bureau said. The program was designed to help participants lose weight on their own, with participants entered into group and individual competitions. Their weights were measured before and after their participation in the events. The person who shed the most weight was a man who lost 24kg in five months, it said. He is to share his experiences in the program at an awards ceremony today, the bureau said. More than 45 percent of adults in the city are overweight or obese, while seven of the top 10 leading causes of death in Chiayi last year were related to obesity, the bureau said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/12/09/2003634404"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-09","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"The defense of Taiwan is probably the most critical and enduring strategic challenge facing US security professionals today, Project 2049 Institute research fellow Ian Easton said on Saturday. \u201cNo other flashpoint is as likely to see the world\u2019s two strongest nations go to war,\u201d Easton told the annual banquet meeting of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs.

Are new trends emerging? Wang Yu-wei (汪毓瑋): Yes. 9/11 is the watershed between old and new terrorism. Older forms of terrorism, such as that of the Irish Republican Army or Spanish ETA [Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, or Basque Country and Freedom, an armed group of the Basque National Liberation Movement], have objectives such as the independence of Northern Ireland or the Basque regions. If they can enter a reasonable and equitable political process with the government, they are willing to negotiate or even make compromises. However, new terrorist organizations, which include al-Qaeda and the IS, wish to build a Sharia state spanning from the Mediterranean to Southeast Asia, that is distinct from existing Muslim-ruled states, such as Saudi Arabia or Indonesia. In the eyes of IS, Saudi Arabia had already absorbed essential qualities of Western democracy, and is therefore a \u201csecular regime.\u201d Older terrorist [organizations] needed to negotiate with the government, and could not use tactics that are excessively cruel or cause too many civilian casualties. Primarily they attacked targets of symbolic value to the state apparatus, such as military personnel, law enforcement, court and civil government officials. Though new terrorists also attack targets that are symbolic of the state apparatus, they do not care about civilians and they even think that attacks on civilians can coerce governments into making concessions or surrender. Causing maximum casualties is their most important objective and therefore they use deliberately cruel tactics to kill as many people as possible and the more people there are in an area, the more likely it will be chosen as a target. [To them] those are necessary sacrifices in a jihad to achieve victory. LT: The US, Russia, France and Germany appear to be joining efforts to fight the IS. What kind of tactics do you think they will use to strike back? How will the situation develop? Wang: The international response includes airstrikes to degrade IS combat capabilities and retaking oil fields, dams, towns and cities. The softer approach is counter-radicalization. The IS has depended on \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d to replenish its numbers. Pull refers to using mosques, jails and the Internet to spread its ideologies and ideas for the purpose of convincing recruits to join it; push refers to the conditions of social injustice and unequal distribution of resources that become an invisible force pushing those who felt uncared for [by society] to the organization. Al-Qaeda and the IS are skillful in building narratives. Therefore, counter-radicalization uses television stations, non-governmental organizations and various activities to publicize the IS narrative. It must be noted that the IS believes in an ultimate war between the Orient and the Occident, a return to the irreconcilable conflict during the age of the Crusades. However, radical Muslims are a minority. They need to recruit moderate Muslims into their organization through [the mechanism of] outrage. Therefore, they use incessant attacks to elicit reaction from nations that were attacked, to facilitate its Internet propaganda campaign: \u201cI am oppressed by Western states because I fight for the ideals and the future of Muslims.

The company said moving the English announcements \u2014 previously broadcast last \u2014 would make travel in Taipei more convenient for foreigners.

WEATHER Pollution high in the south The air quality in Kaohsiung and Pingtung County remained poor yesterday, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said. The PM2.5 indicator in Kaohsiung and Pingtung ranged between level four and level nine on the 10-point scale, the EPA said, adding that the rest of the nation and the outlying islands saw the indicator stay below level four. Level seven or higher on the PM2.5 index, which measures the concentration of pollution by particles 2.5 micrometers or smaller, indicates enough pollution to cause discomfort and health problems, according to the EPA. It was the third consecutive day of high PM2.5 levels for Kaohsiung and neighboring Pingtung, because of a lack of wind to disperse pollutants in the air. Older people and people with chronic lung problems or heart disease should avoid prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical activity in the affected areas, the EPA said. TRANSPORTATION Taipei, Osaka sister stations Taipei Railway Station and West Japan Railway Co\u2019s Osaka Station became sister stations on Friday, with Taipei-Osaka commemorative tickets selling out shortly after going on sale. Taiwan Railways Administration Director-General Chou Yung-hui (周永暉) said that Taipei Railway Station handles more than 500,000 passengers per day and is a transportation hub like Osaka Station. Becoming sister stations would allow the two entities to affirm their friendship, Chou said, adding that the two stations would also introduce mutually beneficial measures in the future.

It was previously believed that the species, commonly referred to as the broad-tailed swallowtail butterfly, belonged to an Asian butterfly genus native to China. Recognized as Taiwan\u2019s \u201cnational butterfly\u201d and known for its rear-protruding hind wings and red crescent mottles, the butterfly is one of only two species of the genus Agehana \u2014 the only class of the Papilionidae family that is native to East Asia. The other species is the Agehana elwesi, a continental butterfly endemic to southern China. Discovered and named by Japanese entomologist Shonen Matsumura in 1936, the broad-tailed swallowtail butterfly had been considered to be closely related to the Agehana elwesi \u2014 to the extent that the butterfly\u2019s status as an independent species had been disputed for more than 70 years, until Taiwanese researchers identified the distinct genetic differences between the continental and insular swallows in 2009 using molecular DNA testing, the Bureau of Forestry said. A team led by National Taiwan University professor Wu Li-wei (吳立偉), National Taiwan Normal University professor Hsu Yu-feng (徐堉峰) and National Sun Yat-sen University professor Yen Sheng-hung (顏聖紘) sampled four specific genes from a total of 86 species within the Papilionidae family to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships and historical scenarios. The team discovered that the genus Agehana actually falls within the American Papilio subgenus Pterourus and is not as previously suggested phylogenetically close to the Asian Papilio subgenus Chilasa, which explains the great morphological distinction of the Agehana from other Asian butterflies, the team said. The team inferred from the dating and biogeographic analysis that an American ancestor of Pterourus was distributed to East Asia in the early Miocene period via the Bering Land Bridge \u2014 which connected Asia and North America at various times during the Pleistocene ice ages \u2014 and developed into the Agehana genus, resulting in the present \u201cEast Asia-America\u201d disjunction distribution. The broad-tailed swallowtail butterfly is classified as an endangered species in Taiwan and listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list of threatened species, the bureau said. The butterfly only feeds on Sassafras randaiense, a vulnerable species of laura tree native to Taiwan that is sparsely distributed across the nation\u2019s Central Mountain Range, it said. The butterfly\u2019s scientific name \u201cmaraho\u201d was derived from the Atayal language, meaning \u201cchieftain\u201d or \u201cleader,\u201d suggesting the unparalleled status of the broad-tailed swallowtail among Taiwan\u2019s butterflies, the bureau said, adding that it has designated 55,991 hectares of forest in Hsinchu County\u2019s Wufeng Township (五峰) and Miaolin County\u2019s Taian Township (泰安) as the butterfly\u2019s conservation area.","source":"taiwan","title":"Iconic butterfly \u2018migrated\u2019 to Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/12/05/2003634077"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Legislation aimed at forcing the White House to quickly transfer two US Navy frigates to Taiwan was introduced into the US Congress on Wednesday. The bill would order US President Barack Obama to provide a detailed timeline for the transfer of the warships within 30 days of it becoming law. Sponsored by US Representative Brad Sherman and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, the bill has substantial support in the House of Representatives. It is part of a growing campaign by members of the US Congress to push Obama into approving new arms sales for Taiwan following more than four years of inaction. Well-placed Washington sources say that Obama will inform Congress of a new arms sales package \u2014 including the frigates \u2014 later this month. \u201cWe should ensure that the laws passed by Congress to provide Taiwan the military equipment it needs to help secure our shared security objectives are faithfully executed,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe United States should not delay in securing the safety of our democratic allies around the world.\u201d Royce said that it was time for the Obama administration to act. \u201cEnsuring the transfer of these frigates to Taiwan is critical to bolstering its defense and ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I led the House in passing naval vessel transfer legislation last year,\u201d Royce added. He said that Taiwan had been waiting for more than a year for the frigates. \u201cThis important bill will press the administration to make good on our commitment to strengthen the US-Taiwan partnership,\u201d Royce said. Among others actively supporting the bill are US Representative Eliot Engel, a ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and US Representative Matt Salmon, chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Last month, US Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain and US Senator Ben Cardin wrote directly to Obama about their concern that Taiwan was not being adequately armed, while China was rapidly expanding its military. \u201cWe are troubled that it has now been over four years \u2014 the longest period since the passage of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979 \u2014 since the administration has notified Congress of a new arms sale package,\u201d the letter read. In December last year, Obama signed the Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2013, allowing the sale of up to four US Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates to Taiwan. The ships approved for sale were the USS Taylor, USS Gary, USS Elrod and USS Carr. Taiwan has agreed to buy two of them \u2014 the Gary and the Taylor \u2014 and has been anxiously waiting for Obama to actually approve the transfer, which has still not happened. Many believe that Obama delayed the final go-ahead because he did not want to upset Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平), whose cooperation he needed at this week\u2019s climate summit in Paris. The ships are guided-missile frigates specially designed for anti-aircraft and anti-submarine duty. \u201cThe Chinese side is firmly opposed to arms sales by the US to Taiwan and this position is steadfast, clear and consistent,\u201d Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qin Gang (秦剛) has said.

More than 1,100 POWs were forced to work in a copper mine at Jinguashi enduring starvation, rampant disease and constant abuse from guards, according to the Taiwan POW Camps Memorial Society. Pett, an enlisted man in the British Army\u2019s 80th Anti-Tank Regiment, was captured during the Battle of Singapore and said he endured inhuman conditions while on a ship transporting him to Taiwan. \u201cI remember most of the brutality of the guards,\u201d Pett said, adding that he believes in commemorating fallen comrades at the site of the former camp, because honoring his friends is \u201cthe right thing to do, and no one else can do it, if not me.\u201d \u201cWe can forgive, but not forget,\u201d Richard Bartelot Jr said, adding that even though his father \u2014 former British Army captain Richard Bartelot, who also served in the 80th Anti-Tank \u2014 did not talk about his days at Kinkaseki, he believes his father forgave the wrongs of the past. Taiwan POW Camps Memorial Society director Michael Hurst said that more than 4,350 POWs were detained in camps in Japan-ruled Taiwan during the war, of whom more than 10 percent died in prison. The POWs were fed meager rations of rice, despite the intense physical labor they performed, and were routinely brutalized not only by Japanese soldiers, but also by Taiwanese troops, who were \u201cabused by the Japanese\u201d and \u201ctreated just better than the prisoners,\u201d Hurst said. In spite of the guards\u2019 brutality, Kinakseki POWs also remembered local Jinguashi residents, who often smuggled food to the prisoners, Hurst said, adding: \u201cTaiwanese [civilians] usually treated the prisoners with kindness.\u201d Pett said his three remembrance visits to Taiwan had helped old wounds heal. \u201cFor over 70 years I used to suffer flashbacks and nightmares about my treatment here, and I still do\u2026 but I can now also reflect on the good times here, which previously never existed. Now the word \u2018Taiwan\u2019 sends thoughts of: \u2018When can I go again?\u2019\u201d Pett said. \u201cWhat a marvelous place. What amazing people,\u201d he added.

The event was designed to showcase Taipei\u2019s artistic touch and creative industry. Of the NT$8.33 billion (US$253.56 million) former Taipei mayor Hau Lung-bin\u2019s (郝龍斌) administration budgeted for the event, the center alone won bids totaling more than NT$286.6 million, which account for 70 percent of the NT$410 million already expended, the councilors said in a joint statement. The center is set to obtain NT$103 million to organize promotional events out of an additional NT$295.3 million Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je\u2019s (柯文哲) administration has proposed to fund the event next year, which was contracted out by the Department of Cultural Affairs as a \u201cspecial project,\u201d they said. Hsu said the International Design Gala award ceremony, which is to be hosted next year by the center at the W Hotel in Taipei\u2019s Xinyi District (信義), is expected to cost the city NT$7.27 million. A budget proposal submitted by the department shows that the center has asked for NT$1.88 million to finance decorations for the event. Hsu questioned the need to host the ceremony at the W Hotel, as there are numerous other options available at significantly lower costs, including the Mandarin Oriental Taipei, at which the city government can use the banquet hall 20 times per year for free under an agreement with the hotel\u2019s management. The city government proposed to pay the center NT$1.07 million for a banquet\u2019s decorations, an event that is expected to cost a total of NT$2.07 million, Hsu said. She called on the department to reduce the number of forums and exhibitions and to focus more on boosting international publicity for Taiwanese artists. Hsu questioned whether the center\u2019s board members \u2014 half of which are government officials \u2014 have managed to give the center a competitive edge over competing firms, as it has won bids for government projects totaling NT$1.5 billion since 2011.

Speaking at a news conference in Taipei, KMT caucus whip Lai Shyh-bao (賴士葆) said that Ma has responded to the public\u2019s expectations by defending the nation\u2019s dignity, citing the Constitution in his explanation to Xi of his stance against Taiwanese independence and Taiwan and China being two separate entities in the international community. Lai also touted Ma broaching the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d with Xi when they met in Singapore. Lai said that requests to let Taiwan join the Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Trans-Asian Railway Network met with goodwill, as Xi had ordered Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) Director Zhang Zhijun (張志軍) to grant Taiwan the memberships \u201cby appropriate means.\u201d Referring to a three-point statement by Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) prior to the meeting, Lai said that Ma had fulfilled at least two requirements that Tsai had said would make his meeting with Xi a \u201chistoric\u201d one. Ma has lived up to Tsai\u2019s expectations of \u201ckeeping Taiwanese democracy and freedom intact\u201d and \u201censuring equality and Taiwan\u2019s dignity,\u201d Lai said, adding that the \u201c1992 consensus\u201d might however not have met Tsai\u2019s proposition that Ma not set any preconditions going into the meeting. KMT Legislator Alex Tsai (蔡正元) said that Ma has taken a \u201cremarkable first step\u201d toward resolving issues across the Taiwan Strait. Ma\u2019s use of the Constitution to dismiss the notion of Taiwanese independence has made him the first president to have a Chinese president acquiesce to the existence of the ROC and its Constitution, Alex Tsai said. This sends a clear message that so long as Taiwan abides by the Constitution, Beijing should not use Taiwanese independence as a pretext to elevate tensions between the two sides, he added. He said that when Ma told Xi that Taiwanese are concerned about missiles Beijing has targeting the nation, Xi assured him that they were not directed at Taiwan. \u201cThis is a promise that is open to our interpretations. We now have the right to interpret whether any of China\u2019s deployment of troops or missiles is hostile toward Taiwan. We can use it as a reference in future discussions and ask them to deliver on this promise,\u201d Alex Tsai said.

Meeting in Singapore on Saturday, China's President Xi Jinping told Taiwan's president they must not let proponents of Taiwan's independence split them, at the first get-together of leaders of the two sides since China's civil war ended in 1949. Ma Ying-jeou, president of self-ruled, democratic Taiwan, where anti-Beijing sentiment has been rising ahead of elections, called for mutual respect for each other's systems and said Taiwan people were concerned about mainland missiles pointing their way. Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has traditionally favored the island's independence, is the frontrunner to win the presidential polls, something Beijing is desperate to avoid happening. China views self-ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as a renegade province, to be bought under its control by force if necessary, and has warned that moves towards formal independence could stoke conflict. In a commentary, the Communist Party's official People's Daily said the two leaders sitting together showed a desire not to let the tragedy of history repeat itself nor to let the fruits of peaceful development be lost. Progress over the past seven years - referring to the rule of the China-friendly Ma - has been possible due to a joint political will to oppose Taiwan independence and accept there is one China, albeit it with different interpretations, the paper said. If this 'magic cudgel' did not exist, the boat of peace would encounter a fierce and frightening storm, or even flip over completely, it wrote. Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait must join together and resolutely oppose the Taiwan independence forces and their separatist activities, the newspaper added. China's Nationalists, also known as the Kuomintang (KMT), retreated to Taiwan after losing the civil war to the Communists, who are still in charge in Beijing. The Communists and Nationalists both agree there is one China but agree to disagree on the interpretation. While bilateral trade, investment and tourism have blossomed - particularly since Ma and his KMT took power in 2008 - there is deep suspicion on both sides and no progress has been made on any sort of political settlement.

They come ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Taiwan in which the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is favoured to win, something Beijing is desperate to avoid. The Nationalists, also known as the Kuomintang (KMT), retreated to Taiwan after losing the civil war to the Communists, who are still in charge in Beijing. China has never renounced the use of force to bring what it considers a breakaway province under its control.

I am here to promise to everyone, we must be doing our best to reach the goal that we set previously, making the Taiwan Strait more peaceful, making the two sides more cooperative, Ma told reporters before boarding his flight to Singapore. Ma, chatting to reporters on board, as Taiwan air force jets escorted his aircraft out of Taiwan air space, said he was neither too nervous nor too relaxed about the meeting. This is an important task. We need to do well at every stage, he said. No agreements are expected in what is seen as a highly symbolic get-together at a luxury hotel in Singapore, a largely ethnic Chinese city-state that has maintained good ties with both for decades. China's official Xinhua news agency said Xi and Ma would exchange views on promoting the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and discuss major issues in deepening cross-Strait cooperation and improving people's welfare. 'Historic juncture' But the handshake sure to take place comes as Xi hopes to cement his place among China's pantheon of great leaders and Ma, stepping down next year due to term limits, tries to shape his legacy marred by growing anti-Beijing feeling in Taiwan. At this historic juncture of a meeting between leaders from both sides of Taiwan Strait, we genuinely hope that both sides can show sincerity, demonstrate goodwill, meet each other half way and confront their difficulties, China's official People's Daily wrote on Saturday. While China is laudatory, concerns have been raised in Taiwan. (Ma) cannot sell out and sacrifice Taiwan's interests, said Chao Tien-lin, director of the department of China affairs of the DPP. He must meet the expectations of democracy and public opinion in Taiwan. This is what we care most about. Ma and Xi meet in the afternoon. Both sides will hold news conferences after a short closed-door meeting, followed by dinner before Ma flies back to Taiwan the same day. It will be of huge symbolic importance, but will not be a 'game-changer', as Taiwanese voters are wary of the mainland's rising influence over the island, Yoel Sano, head of political risk with BMI Research, said of the meeting. Ma will present Xi bottles of spirits made on two groups of islands just off the mainland that have been occupied by Taiwan forces since the end of the civil war. He will also present Xi with a ceramic sculpture of a Taiwan blue magpie perched on a leafy green branch as a gift for their first meeting, a bird unique to the island, Taiwan's presidential office said. Chinese state media said the leaders would eat their dinner at a round table, presumably to avoid the thorny protocol issue of who would sit at the head of it.","source":"toi","title":"Leaders of China, Taiwan to meet for first time in six decades","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/Leaders-of-China-Taiwan-to-meet-for-first-time-in-six-decades/articleshow/49697313.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"China Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"SINGAPORE: The leaders of Taiwan and China shook hands Saturday at a historic meeting marking the first top-level contact between the formerly bitter Cold War foes since they split amid civil war 66 years ago. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou came together on neutral ground in the Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore, walking toward each other in a hotel ballroom in front of a backdrop of yellow, a traditional color of Chinese emperors and flanked by palm trees. The two men smiled broadly as they shook hands for more than one minute, turning slightly to the each side to accommodate a host of photo journalists in the ballroom. In brief opening remarks in front of reporters before going into a closed-door meeting, Xi alluded to China's long-cherished goals of unification with Taiwan, saying ``We are one family'' and ``No force can pull us apart.'' Ma said, ``Both sides should respect each other's values and way of life.'' When they split in 1949, both sides aspired to absorb the other, and Communist Party-ruled China still demands that Taiwan eventually unify, while many citizens of democratic Taiwan increasingly prefer to simply maintain the separate status the island has carved out over six decades. Critics of Ma in Taiwan are wary that his meeting with Xi will pave the way for Beijing to assert control over the island. Each leader hopes to seal his legacy as one who helped bring decades of division and mistrust to a mutually acceptable end. But the meeting is more about the symbolism of coming together than about substance. Both sides have said no agreements will be signed or joint statements issued. Three decades of hostilities followed the 1949 split, occasionally bursting into warfare in the Taiwan Strait, including over the Matsu and Kinmen island group, making dialogue all-but impossible. Tensions eased after China shifted to endorsing the option of peaceful unification'' alongside military threats in 1979, although it wasn't until 1992 that representatives of the two governments met in Singapore to establish the groundwork for future talks. While subsequent talks achieved little, they began bearing fruit after Ma's election in 2008, resulting in 23 agreements on trade and technical matters.

Although it is a self-ruling democracy with a fierce sense of its own identity, Taiwan has never formally declared independence from Beijing, which sees it as a renegade province to be reunified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Overnight protesters tried to storm the heavily-guarded parliament building in Taipei carrying Taiwan independence banners, but were stopped by police, who said there were around 100 demonstrators. There were no arrests. Protesters also gathered at Taipei's Songshan airport where Ma gave a brief address to reporters before boarding his flight today morning. The demonstrators tried to burn images of the two leaders with slogans calling Xi Chinese dictator and Ma a traitor with 27 arrested after they tried to tried to push their way through a guarded side gate. They included student leader Chen Wei-ting a key figure in last year's Sunflower Movement which occupied parliament for almost a month over a controversial trade pact with China. Television footage showed Chen dragged into a police van while officers with riot shields scuffled with protesters. As a president who doesn't represent public opinion, Ma doesn't have the right to meet with the leader across the strait, one 35-year-old protester, also named Chen, told AFP. A TSU spokesman in Taipei said legislative candidate Hsiao Ya-tan was taken away by police from a hostel in Singapore in the early morning, along with two of her assistants.","source":"toi","title":"Protests in Taiwan as Ma leaves for meet with Xi","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Protests-in-Taiwan-as-Ma-leaves-for-meet-with-Xi/articleshow/49699788.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"The Green Party-Social Democratic Party Alliance (Green-SDP) yesterday accused President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) of violating the Criminal Code by arranging to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) tomorrow and called on the High Prosecutors\u2019 Office to bar Ma from leaving the nation while the charges are investigated. \u201cWe do not oppose a meeting between cross-strait leaders, but we are here today to fight for procedural justice,\u201d alliance legislative candidate Lee Yen-jong (李晏榕), an attorney, told a press conference outside the High Prosecutors\u2019 Office before the group submitted their charges.

However, his plan was undone by last year\u2019s Sunflower movement and allegations in August from then-Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) minister Wang Yu-chi (王郁琦) that deputy minister Chang Hsien-yao (張顯耀) was a Chinese spy; a case that was later dismissed by the courts. However, Ma pressed on. The Chinese-language newspaper the Liberty Times (the Taipei Times\u2019 sister paper) broke the news that Ma and Xi are to meet tomorrow in Singapore in an exclusive story published online late on Tuesday. The meeting is one that the international community will undoubtedly scrutinize. Since 2012, Ma has intended to achieve a historic breakthrough in Taiwan-China relations, and arranging a personal summit with the Chinese leader has become his greatest preoccupation. In early 2012, Ma sent then-vice president-elect Wu Den-yih (吳敦義) to the Boao Forum in China to test the waters. Beijing responded by raising the stakes. China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office Director Wang Yi (王毅) told Wu that the Ma administration must shore up \u201cmutual political trust\u201d before further dialogue. In March 2012, Ma sent former Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) chairman Wu Poh-hsiung (吳伯雄) to float the principle of \u201cone country, two areas\u201d (一國兩區) to then-Chinese president Hu Jintao (胡錦濤), which earned Beijing\u2019s plaudits for being a sound basis for political relations. In November 2012, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held its 18th National Congress, which inaugurated Xi as China\u2019s new head of state, and also resolved to call on the Ma administration to join with Beijing to \u201cmake reasonable and sensible accommodations in the cross-strait relationship\u201d that would navigate \u201cthe extraordinary circumstances\u201d of a disunited China. Wang said the meaning of the National Congress declaration was a renunciation of the \u201ctwo Chinas\u201d (兩個中國) as well as \u201cone China, one Taiwan\u201d (一中一台), which made it clear that the CCP message\u2019s intended recipient was the Ma administration. Therefore, Ma considered 2013 the crucial year to secure a summit with Xi. In April 2013, Ma abruptly declared that he would not promote \u201ctwo Chinas,\u201d \u201cone China, one Taiwan,\u201d or Taiwanese independence as his China policy, a statement believed to have been made in order to establish the so-called \u201cmutual political trust\u201d perceived by the other side of the Taiwan Strait. In June 2013, Ma sent Wu to see Xi, to deliver \u201cMa\u2019s seven points,\u201d which were a direct response to Beijing\u2019s demand that Taiwan recognize the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d and to renounce Taiwanese independence as the precondition and the foundation to political relations. The so-called \u201c1992 consensus,\u201d a term former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi (蘇起) said in 2006 that he had made up in 2000, refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the CCP that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means. Wu even responded to Beijing\u2019s \u201cone China framework\u201d (一中框架) with an identical phrase that substituted one character of the word \u201cframework\u201d with a synonym (一中架構). At the conclusion of the meeting, Xi lauded his dialogue with Wu as a \u201chighly significant\u201d one.","source":"taiwan","title":"MA-XI MEETING: Ma legacy might come at significant cost to Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/11/06/2003631820"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-06","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Taiwan Says Meeting With China's Xi Jinping to Further Normalise Cross-Strait Ties","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taiwan-says-meeting-with-chinas-xi-jinping-to-further-normalise-cross-strait-ties-1240390"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.904211","longtitude":"116.407395","location":"Beijing"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Beijing Using Historic Taiwan Meet as Decoy: Research","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/beijing-using-historic-taiwan-meet-as-decoy-research-1240476"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Taiwan-China Summit 'First Step to Normalisation': Ma Ying-jeou","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taiwan-china-summit-first-step-to-normalisation-ma-ying-jeou-1240426"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.44325638","longtitude":"-98.95733643","location":"US"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"US Says Unclear if Taiwan-China Meeting Will Influence Taiwan Elections","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-says-unclear-if-taiwan-china-meeting-will-influence-taiwan-elections-1240299"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-05","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"LABOR Dairy rules to change Employers in the dairy industry soon are to be able to hire foreign workers, a labor official said, citing a consensus reached at a regular policy meeting held on Oct. 19.

The meeting Saturday in Singapore between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Taiwanese counterpart Ma Ying-jeou could be China's last to press its case for closer economic and, ultimately political ties, before Taiwan elects a new president and legislature in January that could put the brakes on Ma's pro-China initiatives. For Ma's ruling Nationalists, who have been lagging at the polls, it could boost their credentials for driving progress in relations with China, but also carries the risk of appearing too close to Beijing, further damaging their chances with skeptical voters. Presidents of the two sides have not met since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost the Chinese civil war to Mao Zedong's Communists and the Nationalists rebased in Taiwan 160 kilometers (100 miles) away in 1949. The two sides have been separately ruled since then, with Taiwan evolving into a freewheeling democracy. China insists that the two sides eventually reunite, by force if necessary. Confirmation of the meeting from Chinese Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office came hours after the Taiwanese side announced the meeting earlier Wednesday. The two would be meeting in their capacity as ``leaders of the two sides'' of the Taiwan Strait, office director Zhang Zhijun was quoted as saying in a news release posted on the office's website. That appeared to afford them equal status, possibly an effort to blunt criticism from the pro-independence opposition in Taiwan who accuse Ma's Nationalist Party of pandering to China's ruling Communists. ``This is a pragmatic arrangement under the situation of the irresolution of cross-strait political differences on the basis of the one-China principle,'' Zhang said, a reference to Beijing's insistence that Taiwan and the mainland are part of a single Chinese nation. The two sides never talked formally until Ma, president since 2008, set aside old hostilities to allow lower-level official meetings. China and Taiwan have signed 23 deals covering mainly trade, transit and investment, binding Taiwan closer to its top trading partner and the world's second-largest economy. Taiwanese presidential spokesman Charles Chen said in a statement Wednesday that the two would exchange ideas about relations but not sign any deals. The choice of Singapore as venue was significant because the Southeast Asian city-state with an ethnic Chinese majority population has strong relations with both Taiwan and China and serves as neutral ground. Singapore hosted breakthrough talks between unofficial Taiwanese and Chinese negotiators in 1992 that established a formula whereby they acknowledge that there is only one China, of which Taiwan is a part, but differ on the exact interpretation. Although Beijing insists on the so-called ``1992 consensus'' as the basis for talks, Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party has refused to embrace it, calling it meaningless and unrepresentative of popular sentiment on the island. Ma is stepping down as president next year after his maximum two terms, and the DPP's candidate Tsai Ing-wen is considered the front-runner to replace him. A DPP victory could prompt a sweeping reassessment of its Taiwan polices by Beijing, which has hoped that economic inducements would lead to greater acceptance of eventual political unification. Ma's government has come under increasing criticism at home for cozying up to China, amid fears Beijing will eventually leverage economic relations to exert more power over the island. Such sentiments helped the DPP to a landslide victory a year ago in local elections, raising the possibility it might win not only the presidency but also a majority in legislative elections also being held Jan. 16. Given the chances of a Nationalist defeat, China is likely to proceed cautiously to avoid further alienating Taiwanese voters. Xi warned Taiwan in 2013 against putting off political differences from generation to generation. China has long advocated a Hong Kong-style one-country, two-system form of joint rule, in which Beijing controls Taiwan but the island of 23 million retains control of its political, legal and economic affairs. That approach has little currency in Taiwan, where most favor the current state of de-facto independence. The statement from Ma's spokesman said the two presidents will meet to ``solidify Taiwan-mainland relations and keep the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.'' ``To hold a meeting across the Taiwan Strait is the consistent goal of leaders on both sides,'' Ma's spokesman said in the statement. ``President Ma recently has repeated many times that `at the right time and on the right occasion and in the right capacity' he would not rule out a meeting.'' Taiwanese officials planned to hold a news conference about the Singapore meeting later Wednesday, and Ma planned to hold one on Thursday. In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. would welcome steps taken on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to try to reduce tensions and improve relations, but added, ``we'll have to see what actually comes out of the meeting.'' Ma is likely hoping for some reassurance from Xi over the use of force and closer economic ties that could help Nationalist Presidential candidate Eric Chu in the polls, said Hong Kong Chinese politics expert Willy Lam. Xi, for his part, likewise hopes a friendly, non-threatening meeting could give the Nationalists a boost, while showing a Chinese domestic audience that he could be the best bet in decades for achieving unification. ``This could be good for his reputation and a feather in his cap,'' said Lam. While the meeting is meant to showcase the Nationalist's adeptness at dealing with China, it carries significant risks for the party, said Sean King, senior vice president with the consultancy Park Strategies in New York and a frequent commentator on Asian affairs. ``This meeting will only hurt the Nationalists at home, as it will cause them to even more be seen as Beijing's preferred Taiwan party,'' King said. ``This could be the mainland's last chance to liaise with the Nationalist Party, while it's in power, for years to come.''","source":"toi","title":"Taiwan, Chinese presidents to meet for first time since 1949","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/Taiwan-Chinese-presidents-to-meet-for-first-time-since-1949/articleshow/49653533.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-04","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Andrew Hsia (夏立言) yesterday dismissed speculation that Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) presidential candidate Eric Chu\u2019s (朱立倫) campaign slogan of \u201cOne Taiwan\u201d is a reference to the state of cross-strait relations.

Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Lin Join-sane (林中森) said that despite the ideological divide between the two nations, the government\u2019s strategy is to shelve disputes and create a win-win situation. \u201cBoth sides should reinforce exchanges on issues they can cooperate over, while putting aside disputes where they disagree,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThis is why we need the initiative of \u2018one China, with different interpretations,\u2019\u201d he said. Lin\u2019s remarks were dismissed by Chuang as off-topic and wishful thinking. Chu\u2019s \u201cOne Taiwan\u201d slogan has been interpreted by some netizens as supporting the cross-strait status of \u201cone Taiwan, one China,\u201d while others regard it as a KMT attempt to capitalize on the name of Taiwan to solicit votes. Chu has said the slogan refers to a united Taiwanese society that brings all people together regardless of their wealth, social status or birthplace. Turning to the APEC leaders\u2019 summit, which is to be held in the Philippines on Nov. 18 and Nov. 19, Hsia said the council is pushing for a meeting between President Ma Ying-jeou\u2019s (馬英九) representative, former vice president Vincent Siew (蕭萬長), and Xi on one of the two days. If such a meeting occurs, the council suggests that the pair discuss issues such as the promotion of the proposed cross-strait agreement on trade in goods, Hsia said. Schedules for the next round of negotiations on the agreement have not yet been set, Hsia said, adding that while both sides are inclined to ink the treaty by the end of this year, it would not be signed prior to the APEC summit.","source":"taiwan","title":"\u2018One Taiwan\u2019 not about ties: minister","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/11/03/2003631582"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-03","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"World Vision Taiwan, a Christian relief and advocacy group, is calling on the public to donate NT$2,000 per month to help 982 needy children grow up in a more healthy environment.

About 60 percent of the parents or grandparents have an education of less than grade nine or middle high school, while some are illiterate. Many of the children live with a parent who is an alcoholic or addicted to gambling and unable to support the family financially, the group said.

In the wake of the emissions scandal, Germany\u2019s federal motor transport authority has ordered a compulsory recall of all affected Volkswagen cars in the country, starting from Jan. 1.

Pillsbury, a former US assistant undersecretary of defense for policy planning, was speaking at a forum titled \u201cBeijing\u2019s Strategy of Unification toward Taiwan and the US Response\u201d at the legislature in Taipei yesterday morning. The event was organized by Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Mark Chen (陳唐山), who served as foreign minister during former president Chen Shui-bian\u2019s (陳水扁) administration. It was attended by several Taiwanese academics and foreign affairs experts. Speaking in fluent Mandarin, Pillsbury said none of the US\u2019 high-ranking officials have openly revealed whether Taiwan is included in its \u201crebalancing\u201d toward Asia, but the policy is expected to continue regardless of who is the next US president. \u201cThat is why Taiwanese people, both in the political or academic industries, are urged to put forward tangible rather than vague suggestions regarding the US\u2019 Asia pivot and clearly express their nation\u2019s aspiration to be a part of it,\u201d Pillsbury said. To address its international and regional exclusion amid growing ties between the US and China, Pillsbury said there are several measures Taiwan can take to undermine Washington-Beijing relations. \u201cIt could change the name designation for Taiwan, issue a different passport, or scrap its current national flag that reminds most people of the Chinese Nationalist Party\u2019s party flag,\u201d Pillsbury said. \u201cHowever, these actions would inevitably been seen as crossing the red line by China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army ... and I personally do not think Taiwan has to go down that road.\u201d Alternatively, Pillsbury said Taipei can surrender to Beijing and announce itself a part of the so-called \u201cmotherland,\u201d but the move would most likely unnerve the US as it is the least favorable option among its citizens. That leaves the nation with one last option: That Taiwanese intelligentsia endeavor to work out a way to allow Taipei to be a helpful partner in Washington\u2019s rebalancing policy without aggravating the Chinese government, Pillsbury said. Pillsbury\u2019s remarks were dismissed by a male participant at the forum, who criticized the US\u2019 opposition of renaming Taiwan as an oppression of the nation. \u201cI did not say Taiwan cannot change its name, I am saying that the US policy of protecting Taiwan\u2019s security is not without limit. It does not mean Taiwan can do whatever it desires and we still have to protect it \u2026. The policy is not a blank check,\u201d Pillsbury said. Former minister of national defense Michael Tsai (蔡明憲) urged the US to permit Taiwan to participate in meetings and cooperative organizations related to its regional security, and respect the nation\u2019s public opinion and development. \u201cThe US should not facilitate its ties with China at the expense of Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and its people\u2019s interests,\u201d said Tsai, who also doubles as the director-general of the Taiwan Defense Policy and Strategy Research Institute.

Judicial officials said the prostitution ring allegedly contravened international laws against human trafficking, because an investigation revealed that some of the call girls flew to China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, the US and Australia to provide sexual services or as \u201cbusiness trip companions,\u201d mostly for businessmen and other wealthy clientele. Three women with alleged involvement were summoned for questioning at the Taipei District Prosecutors\u2019 Office on Tuesday night, including the female proprietor, Tai Chun-yi (戴君儀), model agency manager Chung Yi-tzu (鍾宜姿) and Johanne Liou (劉喬安), whose good looks led the local media to dub her the \u201cSunflower Queen\u201d during her participation in the Sunflower movement last year. After questioning, the three, who prosecutors suspected of violating the Human Trafficking Prevention Act (人口販運防制法), were released yesterday morning with bail set at NT$500,000 (US$15,297), NT$250,000 and NT$50,000 respectively. The prosecutors followed up by summoning a number of suspects and witnesses for questioning yesterday afternoon, who included a female model who starred as the lead and spokesperson in an advertising campaign for a computer game, and other models and starlets said to be working in the entertainment industry. Because some of the women said they were not working of their own free will and had been threatened, the investigation has proceeded based on the suspicion that Tai, Liou and others were engaged in cross-border human trafficking. Reports said US authorities informed Taiwan of the ring\u2019s existence through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). In response to media queries, AIT official Joseph Bookbinder said he would not comment on individual cases, but he did say that Taiwan and the US work together to fight crime. Officials at the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said that after a tip-off by US agencies, they monitored Tai\u2019s activities and financial transactions for the past six months, before concluding that Tai operated the ring in Taiwan, but with powerful backers and the real masterminds in China. Officials said Tai provided Taiwanese starlets, models and showgirls as \u201cbusiness trip companions\u201d for wealthy clientele from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and also for overseas Chinese living in US, Australia and other countries. It is reported the sex workers sometimes spent between three days and a week abroad, with their clients paying between NT$500,000 and NT$2 million, and would also usually pay for business-class airfare tickets, five-star hotel billets, restaurant dining and other expenses for the escorts during their trips.

Greenpeace reported last month that a Taiwanese fishing vessel, the Shuen De Ching No. 888, was illegally harvesting shark fins and throwing the bodies of the sharks into the sea near Papua New Guinea in the South Pacific. The European Commission issued a yellow card to Taiwan on Oct. 1, warning that it risked being identified as an uncooperative country in the fight against \u201cillegal, unreported and unregulated\u201d fishing. Greenpeace said the Fisheries Agency sent officials to check on the Shuen De Ching No. 888 following the ship\u2019s return to Taiwan and found that it had falsely recorded its catch, cut fins off sharks and thrown their bodies into the sea, and violated the ban on fishing for black sharks. However, the agency\u2019s count of the ship\u2019s catch was far short of Greenpeace\u2019s, indicating that it is not capable of plugging management loopholes, Greenpeace said. That raised doubts that the agency would be able to solve the yellow card problem within six months, Greenpeace said, and if Taiwan cannot make improvements within that time frame, the EU could impose trade sanctions on Taiwanese seafood. Based on its annual fish exports to the EU, Taiwan stands to lose about NT$520 million (US$15.91 million) a year, it said. Greenpeace oceans campaigner Yen Ning (顏寧) said the captain of the Taiwanese ship admitted that it transported a catch early last month, but an investigation by the Fisheries Agency had found nothing and it ended up saying only that the ship made an incorrect report. The agency fined the ship NT$150,000 and its catch was confiscated, a punishment Yen said was too lenient. Yen said that reform of Taiwan\u2019s deep-sea fishing system is urgent.

EDUCATION Parents eye US education Seventy-five percent of Taiwanese parents are considering sending their children abroad for their university education, with the US remaining the top destination, according to a survey conducted by HSBC. When given the choice of where they would be willing to send their children to study, 60 percent of respondents chose the US, while the UK and Germany each received the support of 38 percent, the survey found. The global survey conducted earlier this year in 16 nations interviewed 300 Taiwanese parents with at least one child younger than 23. Though Taiwanese respondents indicated that they would like to send their children abroad to study, cost could be a barrier. An international student in the US is expected to spend more than US$165,000 in total university tuition and living expenses over four years, HSBC said. In the UK, the cost is approximately US$120,000. By comparison, it is more economical to attend a Taiwanese university, which costs about US$44,000 over a four-year period, HSBC said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/28/2003631131"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Chinese growth is good for Taiwan","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/10/27/2003631011"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-27","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Thanks to the perseverance of police in search of her roots, a woman who was born in Taiwan and adopted by a Finnish couple when she was a baby has found her biological father and has made plans to meet him in February in Taiwan.

Schmitt said that the US can reverse this dynamic by inviting Taiwan\u2019s military to participate in joint and multilateral exercises, by expanding the transfer of weapons and by allowing more frequent and substantive visits by Cabinet members. He also called for a more substantial role for Taiwan in international bodies and endorsing Taiwan\u2019s bid to become a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership once the trade pact is up and running. The commentary followed an article published by the AEI last week calling on the US to rethink its approach to Taiwan. \u201cImposing artificial restrictions on interactions with Taiwan, as much as they might please Beijing, do not contribute to stability in the Taiwan Strait,\u201d the article by AEI defense policy analyst Michael Mazza said. \u201cPreparing for the worst \u2014 by talking to, training with and operating alongside Taiwan\u2019s military \u2014 is the best way to ensure that the worst does not come about,\u201d Mazza said.

The storm was previously expected to move closer to Taiwan on Tuesday, but the bureau said that it would take longer for Koppu to bring heavy rain to the nation, given that it is now moving at a slower pace. Starting from Tuesday, Taiwan is expected to feel a stronger impact from the typhoon and see heavy rain due to its peripheral current, the bureau said. HEALTH Chickens to be culled About 20,000 free-range chickens at a farm in Changhua County\u2019s Dacheng Township (大城) are to be culled today after they tested positive for influenza A virus subtype H5N2, a highly pathogenic variant of avian influenza. It is the second confirmed case of bird flu at the farm this year, which resumed poultry farming in July after a mass culling and disinfection, Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Director-General Chang Su-san (張淑賢) said, adding that sentinel chickens were raised during the preoperative period to ensure that the virus was not active in the environment. Migrant birds might be a possible source of contagion, as the affected farm is located along the shore and it is migration season, Chang said. PUBLIC HEALTH Dengue cases reach 24,874 Another 367 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Taiwan, bringing the total number of infections since the start of May to 24,874, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday. In Tainan, 183 new cases were reported on Friday, which was 16 fewer than on the same day last week, the CDC said. Kaohsiung reported 173 new cases, 39 more than a week earlier. From the start of the outbreak up until Friday, the three worst-affected areas are Tainan, with 20,172 reported cases, Kaohsiung (4,274) and Pingtung County (100), CDC figures showed. Since May 1, there have been 106 confirmed fatalities in the nation from the disease, the CDC said. While 22,500 dengue patients have recovered, 44 are still being treated in intensive care units, CDC statistics showed. CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) predicted that numbers of reported cases of dengue fever in Kaohsiung would start to slow by the end of this month as the weather cools. ELECTIONS FTP calls for candidates The newly formed Free Taiwan Party (FTP), which advocates Taiwan independence, is inviting people who share its political ideals to join it and run for seats in next year\u2019s legislative elections. A new political party needs to nominate candidates in at least 10 of the 73 electoral districts in order to qualify to run for seats in the Legislative Yuan. The FTP is hoping that if it can qualify to run, it could win 5 percent of the votes and win one of 34 party-list seats, FTP Chairman Tsay Ting-kuei (蔡丁貴) said. Tsay said that by representing the FTP in the Jan. 16 elections, politicians interested in public office could build their reputation through increased public exposure. However, the FTP, as a new party, is concentrating more on the 2018 city and county council elections, he added.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/18/2003630351"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-18","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Pro-China party dumps president candidate in Taiwan","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/Pro-China-party-dumps-president-candidate-in-Taiwan/articleshow/49436620.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-18","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Taiwan still has a long way to go before it can gain entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, a senior US official said this week. \u201cThere is a lot more that can and should be done,\u201d US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs Daniel Russel said. \u201cMy message to Taiwan regarding TPP is this: Keep up the good work.\u201d Russel was answering questions at the Foreign Press Center in Washington after US President Barack Obama\u2019s summit with South Korean President Park Geun-hye.

AGRICULTURE Fruit virus test developed Taiwanese researchers have developed a test for viruses that affect the seedlings of passion fruit, a tropical crop that generates substantial annual revenue. The two test kits can detect at least six strains of passion fruit viruses and halve the time normally spent checking seedlings\u2019 health, said Tsay Jyh-rong (蔡志榮), deputy director-general of the Council of Agriculture\u2019s Taiwan Agriculture Research Institute. By detecting passion fruit viruses during the crop\u2019s planting season, farmers will be able to grow healthy plants and obtain better harvests, he said, adding that the technique for producing the test kits can be passed on to local seedling breeders for commercialization. The nation produced 7,958 tonnes of passion fruit in 2013, with an output value of approximately NT$400 million (US$12.2 million), Tsay said. The industry risks a 30 percent loss in production value when the crop is attacked by viruses, he said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan News Quick Take","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/15/2003630125"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-15","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Researchers have found ethnobotanical support for the \u201cout of Taiwan\u201d theory of Austronesian expansion by identifying that the DNA sequences of paper mulberry trees found on Pacific islands originated from Taiwan. An international team led by National Taiwan University forestry professor Chung Kuo-fang (鍾國芳) analyzed the chloroplast DNA sequences of 604 paper mulberry samples collected from East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Pacific islands, and found that a specific haplotype, cp-17, which originated in Taiwan, is predominant across the region. It is assumed that paper mulberry, a common East Asian tree used for making paper, was transported across the Pacific by Austronesian people, who used the tree to make bark cloth, Chung said. The team\u2019s analysis found that the genetic structure and evolutionary development of Oceanic paper mulberries are concurrent with the paper mulberries in southern Taiwan, which offers circumstantial support for the \u201cout of Taiwan\u201d theory of Austronesian expansion, Chung said. Paper mulberry is a dioecious species, meaning that the male and female reproductive organs are found on separate plants. Most Pacific paper mulberries are of a single sex, so they cannot reproduce naturally, but rely on humans for propagation, Chung said, adding that those conditions are critical to preserving the genetic structure of the tree. The study was the first to use the migration of \u201ccommensal species\u201d \u2014 non-native animals or plants that are instrumental to human survival and are introduced into a region \u2014 to support the \u201cout of Taiwan\u201d hypothesis, he said, adding that linguistic, archeological and genetic studies have produced important evidence that points to Taiwan as an Austronesian ancestral homeland. The \u201cout of Taiwan\u201d hypothesis is a mainstream model of Austronesian expansion, which assumes that a large-scale expansion began between 5000 BC and 2500 BC, when Austronesian-speaking peoples migrated from Taiwan to Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The research also provides insight into the dispersal of paper mulberry from southern China into northern Taiwan, as a large amount of mulberry pollen was discovered in sediments in Taipei that could be dated back to 5000 BC, about the same time pre-Austronesian-speaking peoples from southern China are believed to have migrated to Taiwan, Chung said. Stone beaters \u2014 that were used by Austronesian migrants to make bark cloth \u2014 found at archeological sites in northern Taiwan could also be dated back to about 5000 BC, suggesting that ancestral Austronesians migrated from southern China to northern Taiwan and planted the trees along the migration route, he said. The team spent seven years collecting and analyzing paper mulberry samples from Pacific islands and Southeast Asia, and the results were published in the academic journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences earlier this month.","source":"taiwan","title":"Tree distribution supports \u2018out of Taiwan\u2019 hypothesis","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/15/2003630122"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-15","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"SOCIETY New rule for response times A new rule requiring medical rescue teams to arrive at accidents at amusement and theme parks within four to six minutes will come into force on Nov. 15, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said yesterday.

Birds are accessible, interesting and somewhat mysterious,\u201d said the 29-year-old from the US, who set a world record on Sept. 16 for notching up the most birds spotted in a calendar year \u2014 which is known in the birding world as the \u201cBig Year\u201d challenge. For Strycker, the magic bird \u2014 No. 4,342 since Jan. 1, helping him break a record \u2014 was a Sri Lankan frogmouth, a greyish bird he spotted in the Thattekad Bird Sanctuary in India. However, Strycker \u2014 who is recording his journey in a blog called \u201cBirding Without Borders\u201d for the US-based National Audubon Society, a nonprofit environmental organization dedicated to bird conservation \u2014 is not satisfied with his tally. Aiming to observe at least 5,000 bird species in his Big Year challenge, the globetrotting birder is to visit Taiwan this week in a bid to add 100 new species to his count in four days. The task might sound daunting, but luckily Strycker is to be assisted by the Chinese Wild Bird Federation, Taiwan\u2019s most established birding society, and two of the nation\u2019s foremost birders. With the help of Wayne Hsu (許哲瑋), the federation\u2019s director of conservation and international affairs, and Hung Kuan-chieh (洪貫捷), a former director of the federation, Strycker said he is expecting to see a lot of birds. \u201cTaiwan is an important stop on my 2015 world Big Year effort to become the first human to see half of the world\u2019s bird species \u2014 about 5,000 \u2014 in a single year,\u201d Strycker said. However, to meet that goal a precise, but flexible plan is needed, Hsu said. \u201cThe focus will have to be the Dasyueshan National Forest Recreation Area,\u201d Hsu said, referring to Taiwan\u2019s birding paradise, where 26 of Taiwan\u2019s 27 endemic bird species can be observed. Although the objective is clear, the plan cannot be fixed and has to take numerous variables into consideration, including weather, traffic and, most of all, luck. For now, Strycker\u2019s whirlwind tour is to start with camping on Dasyueshan (大雪山) in Taichung County from tomorrow to Friday. That is to be followed on Saturday with a visit to the nearby Huisun National Forest Recreation Area in Nantou County for birds like the Taiwan blue magpie and the varied tit. Finally, after a trip on Sunday to southern parts of the nation to see Taiwan bulbuls and black-faced spoonbills, Strycker is to conclude his journey at about midnight and take an overnight flight to the Philippines for the next stop of his odyssey. The main focus of the trip is to observe as many bird species as possible, Strycker said, adding that it would still be nice to simply marvel at beautiful creatures that can only be found in Taiwan. \u201cI hope to get a glimpse of the rare and magnificent Mikado and Swinhoe\u2019s pheasants in their natural environment at Dasyueshan,\u201d Strycker said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any trip to Taiwan would be complete without a look at a Taiwan blue magpie \u2014 Taiwan\u2019s national bird, beautiful and awesome,\u201d he said. Strycker\u2019s visit could stir up interest in birding and raise conservation awareness in Taiwan, Hsu said. \u201cTaiwan has one of the highest densities of bird species in the world, and is seeing a growth in the number of people interested in birding,\u201d Hsu said.","source":"taiwan","title":"Taiwan key stop in birder\u2019s \u2018Big Year\u2019","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/14/2003630040"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-14","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Over 100 dengue deaths in Taiwan","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/Over-100-dengue-deaths-in-Taiwan/articleshow/49347082.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-10-14","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"ENVIRONMENT Spoonbills begin arriving The annual black-faced spoonbill season is to commence on Nov. 8, with the Tainan Ecological Conservation Association hosting a series of activities for bird watchers at the Zengwun Estuary Wetlands and the Black-faced Spoonbill Ecology Exhibition Hall in Tainan.
