The drill is to include practice calming passengers, negotiating with terrorists and carrying out a counterterrorism raid, Metropolitan Transport Corp head Hung Tsang-lang (洪滄浪) said. The aim is to train police and other personnel, and increase public awareness of possible terrorism, Hung said. The drill is gaining extra attention amid fears that Taiwan could become a target of the Islamic State after the national flag appeared in a propaganda video made by the group. The flag was among the banners of 60 other nations that appeared in the video and was displayed next to the US flag. Awareness of antiterrorism measures in Taiwan was heightened after US President Barack Obama named Taiwan as part of an Asia-Pacific coalition against the Islamic State during the ASEAN East Asia summit in Kuala Lumpur on Nov. 22. Hung said that bus companies in Taipei have regularly staged such drills over the past few years. The preparatory work for this year\u2019s drill started four months ago, prior to the terrorist attacks in Paris last month, Hung said. The drill is set to be staged at a station in Neihu District (內湖), with the participation of about 60 people, including more than 20 special forces personnel. Buses, firefighting vehicles, ambulances and police vehicles are to be deployed for the drill, Hung said. Specialized weapons will be carried during the drill, Hung added.","source":"taiwan","title":"Drill planned to simulate terrorist attacks on buses","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/12/09/2003634391"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-09","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"'You Ain't No Muslim, Bruv': Britons Defiant Over 'Terrorist' Knife Attack","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/you-aint-no-muslim-bruv-britons-defiant-over-terrorist-knife-attack-1252199"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-08","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"54.56088638","longtitude":"-2.212511778","location":"UK"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"UK Police Charge Man Over 'Terrorist Incident' At London Metro Station","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-police-charge-man-over-terrorist-incident-at-london-metro-station-1252161"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Barack Obama in Speech to Nation Vows to Defeat 'New Phase' of Terrorist Threat","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/barack-obama-in-speech-to-nation-vows-to-defeat-new-phase-of-terrorist-threat-1251845"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.69781","longtitude":"120.960515","location":"Taiwan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Liberty Times (LT): From the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to the Islamic State (IS) group\u2019s recent attacks in France, are international terrorist attacks changing into something new? Are new trends emerging? Wang Yu-wei (汪毓瑋): Yes. 9/11 is the watershed between old and new terrorism. Older forms of terrorism, such as that of the Irish Republican Army or Spanish ETA [Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, or Basque Country and Freedom, an armed group of the Basque National Liberation Movement], have objectives such as the independence of Northern Ireland or the Basque regions. If they can enter a reasonable and equitable political process with the government, they are willing to negotiate or even make compromises. However, new terrorist organizations, which include al-Qaeda and the IS, wish to build a Sharia state spanning from the Mediterranean to Southeast Asia, that is distinct from existing Muslim-ruled states, such as Saudi Arabia or Indonesia. In the eyes of IS, Saudi Arabia had already absorbed essential qualities of Western democracy, and is therefore a \u201csecular regime.\u201d Older terrorist [organizations] needed to negotiate with the government, and could not use tactics that are excessively cruel or cause too many civilian casualties. Primarily they attacked targets of symbolic value to the state apparatus, such as military personnel, law enforcement, court and civil government officials. Though new terrorists also attack targets that are symbolic of the state apparatus, they do not care about civilians and they even think that attacks on civilians can coerce governments into making concessions or surrender. Causing maximum casualties is their most important objective and therefore they use deliberately cruel tactics to kill as many people as possible and the more people there are in an area, the more likely it will be chosen as a target. [To them] those are necessary sacrifices in a jihad to achieve victory. LT: The US, Russia, France and Germany appear to be joining efforts to fight the IS. What kind of tactics do you think they will use to strike back? How will the situation develop? Wang: The international response includes airstrikes to degrade IS combat capabilities and retaking oil fields, dams, towns and cities. The softer approach is counter-radicalization. The IS has depended on \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d to replenish its numbers. Pull refers to using mosques, jails and the Internet to spread its ideologies and ideas for the purpose of convincing recruits to join it; push refers to the conditions of social injustice and unequal distribution of resources that become an invisible force pushing those who felt uncared for [by society] to the organization. Al-Qaeda and the IS are skillful in building narratives. Therefore, counter-radicalization uses television stations, non-governmental organizations and various activities to publicize the IS narrative. It must be noted that the IS believes in an ultimate war between the Orient and the Occident, a return to the irreconcilable conflict during the age of the Crusades. However, radical Muslims are a minority. They need to recruit moderate Muslims into their organization through [the mechanism of] outrage. Therefore, they use incessant attacks to elicit reaction from nations that were attacked, to facilitate its Internet propaganda campaign: \u201cI am oppressed by Western states because I fight for the ideals and the future of Muslims. You must rise up to fight by our side.\u201d","source":"taiwan","title":"INTERVIEW: Terrorist attacks in Taiwan a possibility, expert says","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/12/07/2003634227"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"51.507351","longtitude":"-0.127758","location":"London"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"London Tube Stabbings 'Terrorist Incident': Police","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/anti-terror-police-probe-london-tube-knife-attacks-1251517"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-06","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"51.507351","longtitude":"-0.127758","location":"London"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Knife Attacker Slashes Man in London 'Terrorist Incident'","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/knife-attacker-slashes-man-in-london-terrorist-incident-1251745"},"time":{"from":"2015-12-06","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"Guwahati: Life has come full circle for Ulfa founding general secretary Golap Baruah alias Anup Chetia's 20-year-old daughter Bonnya Boruah.

As a teenager, he joined the Al-Muhajiroun, a radical Islamist group which is linked to many terror attacks in the UK, including the 7/7 London bombings. It's been 10 years since Adam severed links with al-Muhajiroun. Now, a senior researcher at Quilliam Foundation, a London-based think tank, he works to put out a counter-narrative to radical Islamists. Deen tells Rakhi Chakrabarty over phone from London about his journey into and out of the world of Islamists. How did you get introduced to a dangerous group like the Al-Muhajiroun? I came across it while studying information technology at the University of Westminster. This is the same university where Jihadi John (an Islamic State militant) studied. He may have joined it after I left. As an immigrant in the UK, did you face problems growing up that pushed you towards a radical cult? I was born in London. My parents came to London from Turkey for work in 1970s. Ours was a secular liberal family, where Islam was a culture not an ideology. My mother wore Western clothes. I wasn't interested in religion or politics. I never had a problem. I was not angry or disenfranchised. At university, I started talking to extremist organizations and engaging with them. I was in my teens. I wanted to learn about my faith. They presented an intellectual version of Islam, something I had not heard before. They made Islam seem relevant. As a young Western Muslim, I was captivated. My lifestyle changed. I stopped socializing with my old friends, family and people of the opposite sex as I believed they were misguided and not good Muslims. I looked down upon my parents and thought they were inadequate Muslims. I had found a different circle of friends. I was living and breathing what the Islamists told me. I was very proud of the organization. Up until then, Islam was something distant. When I went to their lectures, they would talk about the Prophet and religious identity. From a British Muslim, I became a Muslim in Britain. I felt closer to the Muslim world and shunned British values. I was politicized and anti-American. I wasn't looking for adventure. I genuinely felt the need to be a better Muslim. My parents were oblivious to my transformation. About a year after joining the organization, they saw me on TV presenting Islamist views. One day, my dad found me giving out leaflets about the establishment of the Islamic Caliphate at a mosque. He was embarrassed. He told me I was hanging around with bad people. I ignored him. Is it only the urge to be a better Muslim that draws youth to radicals? Adverse economic and social conditions that disenfranchise young Muslims are contributing factors. They feel they don't have a voice. They are open to listening to anti-establishment attacks to carrying out more violent acts. It's a journey from being angry to being a potential terrorist. Islamists present a binary view where the world is split up into good and evil. All that is good is on the side of Islam. The West and everyone else is evil. They make committing crime and violence seem acceptable. They dehumanize. They promote victimhood of Muslims. When did you start getting disillusioned? At a much later stage, somebody older to me left the organization. He talked to me. There were also questions in my mind about what I was doing. I also took to studying Western philosophy with a mentor. My critical faculties were developed. I could see that there was more knowledge outside the (extremist) organization. What I was being told seemed untenable. It was a slow process of dissent. The extremist version of Islam seemed a deviation from what Islam really is. Over time, I drifted away. When they found out, I was faced with much hostility. Islamists are hostile to criticism. You can't ask questions. I was called an apostate and a betrayer and told that I should be executed. But, it was too late for them. What is the counter-narrative you are working on? The counter-narrative to Islamists is a challenge. We are trying to debunk their world view and counter their theological discourse. Those who interpret Islam as anti-rationalistic and at odds with basic ethical principles have a disproportionate hold on Muslims. While proclaiming Islam as a rational religion, they argue that killing apostates is Islamic. I believe in Islam that's tolerant, liberal and encourages freedom. It's important for Muslims to be self-critical. After leaving Islamists, I was free to explore Islam and its rich intellectual heritage. But when you speak out against status quo, there's a backlash. My aim is very clear. We have to identify, isolate and challenge their toxic theologic view, call it out within our communities.","source":"toi","title":"It\u2019s a journey from being angry to being a potential terrorist: Adam Deen","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/Its-a-journey-from-being-angry-to-being-a-potential-terrorist-Adam-Deen/articleshow/49874232.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-22","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"36.28164673","longtitude":"139.0772705","location":"Japan"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"In the wake of the Paris attacks, the government speeds up plans for the Foreign Ministry\u2019s new intelligence-gathering unit to begin terrorist monitoring operations overseas.","source":"japantimes","title":"Japan's terrorist monitoring unit to maintain four bases abroad: in Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia and India","url":"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/21/national/japans-planned-terrorist-monitoring-unit-will-four-bases-abroad-jordan-egypt-indonesia-india/"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-21","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"17.570692","longtitude":"-3.996166","location":"Mali"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Indian-American Woman Killed in Mali Terrorist Attack","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/indian-american-woman-killed-in-mali-terrorist-attack-1245871"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-21","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"17.570692","longtitude":"-3.996166","location":"Mali"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"WASHINGTON : An Indian-American is among at least 27 people killed during a deadly siege of a Mali hotel by Islamic extremists.

The news carried by the government-run Xinjiang Daily was the first official mention of the September 18 attack at the Sogan colliery in Aksu, in which it said 16 people, including 5 police officers were killed, and another 18 people injured. Radio Free Asia, which first reported the incident about two months ago, said at least 50 people had died. Attackers fled into the mountains and authorities launched a manhunt with more than 10,000 people participating every day, forming an inescapable dragnet, the Xinjiang Daily said. After 56 days of continuous fighting, Xinjiang destroyed a violent terrorist gang directly under the command of a foreign extremist group. Aside from one person who surrendered, 28 thugs were completely annihilated, the newspaper said. China's government says it faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists in energy-rich Xinjiang, on the border of central Asia, where hundreds have died in violence in recent years. Rights groups say China has never presented convincing evidence of the existence of a cohesive militant group fighting the government. Much of the unrest, they argue, is due to frustration at controls over the culture and religion of the Uighur people who live in Xinjiang, a charge Beijing denies. The Xinjiang Daily said two people who appeared to have Uighur names were leaders of the unnamed foreign group. Beginning in 2008, the Xinjiang group's members began watching extremist videos and communicated six times with an extremist group outside of China's borders, requesting tactical guidance, the paper said. Members of this foreign extremist group transmitted orders to the gang many times and demanded pledges of loyalty, it said, without elaborating. It is unclear why the government had not disclosed the incident earlier. Officials says some Uighurs have gone to fight with radical groups in the Middle East. Western nations have been reluctant to cooperate in China's anti-terrorism campaign in Xinjiang, nervous about being implicated in possible human rights abuses, accusations China denies.

The Sikh writer and journalist from Canada found an innocuous bathroom selfie had been photoshopped with a Quran in his hand and a suicide vest over his torso. The image had been splashed over European media and the Internet. The online community soon came forward to dispel the falsehood, sharing the original picture, where a smiling Jubbal is clicking a picture of himself with an iPad (later photoshopped into a copy of the Quran), camera facing a mirror. Besides La Razon and an Italian news channel called Sky committed the same error. Veerender Jubbal was among the national trends in Spain on Sunday. La Razon tweeted an apology later from their official account in Spanish saying: Yesterday we erroneously published a picture of @Veeren_Jubbal confusing him with one of the Paris terrorists. We ask for your pardon. At the time of writing, the origin of the photoshopped image had not yet been traced. Both Jubbal, who has over 11,000 Twitter followers, and his friends and supporters carried out an intense round of firefighting through Sunday and most of Monday, tweeting the original pictures and setting the record straight. After explaining what had transpired, and soliciting messages of support, Jubbal tweeted: You can all check the last retweets. Let us start with basics. Never been to Paris. Am a Sikh dude with a turban. Lives in Canada. He also tweeted about getting a phone call from a cousin in India, who saw the coverage. Jubbal said he might sue the media agencies responsible. Jubbal could not be contacted at the time of going to press. Had this been under the Indian law, says lawyer Apar Gupta, the law of torts would apply. A person can take refuge under the tort of emotional distress, and claim monetary compensation for the anticipated harm and the distress caused, says Gupta. The harm in this case, could have been chillingly real. Rohini Lakshane, a researcher with the Bengaluru-based Center for Internet and Society prescribes using technical means to tell hoax from truth. There are technical means for figuring out if an image has been doctored, there are websites such as Snopes and Hoax Slayer that debunk falsified stories, there is keen observation needed to spot the holes in a hoax or a rumour, and there is common sense. As for the media outlets that published the doctored image, it was irresponsible of them to pass on an unverified piece of news. Sometimes content published on satire websites and 'fictitious news' websites finds its way into newspapers and broadcast as legitimate news. The only way to counter the spread of online hoaxes is to fight misinformation with information. Jubbal is no stranger to online harassment. Since 2014, he had been at the receiving end of vicious abuse for speaking out against non-diverse and unequal depictions of races and genders in online gaming. While some friends and supporters of Jubbal conveyed deep disgust at the recent virtual attack, often devolving into profanities, the man himself remained calm and graceful through it all. The most strongly worded tweet from him read: Learn the difference between me being a Sikh, and a Muslim. Cry in mug, while I use your tears to water my garden. I am valuable, and rad.","source":"toi","title":"Spanish daily wrongly labels Canadian Sikh as 'terrorist'","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Spanish-daily-wrongly-labels-Canadian-Sikh-as-terrorist/articleshow/49810629.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-17","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"48.856614","longtitude":"2.352222","location":"Paris"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"edit-taiwan","title":"Terrorist attacks cast Paris into \u2018an impossible nightmare\u2019","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.comNews/editorials/archives/2015/11/16/2003632560"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"61.52401","longtitude":"105.318756","location":"Russia"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Russia Says Hezbollah Not a Terrorist Group: Report","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-says-hezbollah-not-a-terrorist-group-report-1243882"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"NEW DELHI: The National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K), all its formations and front organisations were declared as terrorist organisations on Monday by the ministry of home affairs.

Mohammed Emwazi, who appeared in a series of gory propaganda videos showing the beheading of foreign journalists and aid workers last year, was targeted in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa last night. There has been no official confirmation of his death but a senior US military official told Fox News: We are 99 per cent sure we got him. Another official speaking to ABC News described the air strike that as a flawless and clean hit that evaporated Emwazi without killing civilians. Activists from anti-ISIS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said a drone targeted the car Emwazi was travelling in near the Islamic Court, which enforces the group's interpretation of Sharia law, in the city centre. A Facebook post said the first explosion hit at around 11.41pm local time (9.41pm GMT) and that around a dozen more air strikes were counted before midnight. A senior US military source told the BBC Emwazi had been tracked carefully over a period of time and that there is a high degree of certainty that the mission was a success. At least one other person is believed to have in the car when it was hit. The Pentagon has confirmed the air strike but said it would not formally announce the result until it had been fully assessed. A spokesperson for Downing Street said: We are aware of the US statement about the airstrike targeting Mohammed Emwazi. Like them, we are not commenting further at this stage. Emwazi, who was born in Kuwait but moved to London as a child, is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2013 to join the so-called Islamic State. He gained his nickname from his part in a group of British militants dubbed The Beatles by fellow jihadists. The former IT student rose to prominence after appearing in a video showing the murder of US journalist James Foley in August last year. Emwazi then appeared in videos showing the deaths of American journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and UK taxi driver Alan Henning, US aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto. Wearing a black robe and balaclava, he claimed the attacks were revenge for British and American foreign policy and was not identified until February this year.","source":"toi","title":"IS terrorist Jihadi John 'killed by drone strike'","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//articleshow/49768103.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-11-13","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"AMRITSAR: Deepening the crisis within Sikh religious affairs, radical Sikhs on Tuesday announced the appointment of convicted Khalistani terrorist Jagtar Singh Hawara as the Jathedar (chief) of the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikh religion. The congregation of radicals also announced the removal of all Sikh high priests. The appointment was announced by radical Sikh leaders during a 'Sarbat Khalsa' (grand assembly of Sikhs) congregation at Chaba near Amritsar on Tuesday. Hawara is the main accused in the assassination of then Punjab chief minister Beant Singh who was killed by a human bomb in Chandigarh on August 31, 1995. The congregation decided that the present Akal Takht Jathedar Gurbachan Singh be removed from his post and that Hawara, who is serving a life term in the Beant Singh assassination case, be appointed. During the congregation, in view of Hawara being in prison, the leaders announced that former MP D.S. Mand would be the interim jathedar of the Akal Takht and would address the Sikh community from the shrine, located inside the Golden Temple complex, on Diwali on Wednesday. The congregation was organised by a few radical Sikh groups. Accusing them of genocide of Sikhs, the congregation named former police chief K.P.S. Gill and Operation Bluestar commander K.S.

Though 86 terrorists were neutralized till October 25 against 83 in the same period of 2014 and the civilian casualties caused while maintaining law and order stagnated at four, the number of civilian killings by the militants fell to 16 from 20 last year. READ ALSO: Two militants killed in encounter in Jammu and Kashmir The latest statistics mark a year-on-year increase in most terror indices related to JandK. In fact, at 169 incidents until October 25, the figure of 170 incidents recorded in the whole of 2014 is set to be surpassed soon. Nevertheless, incidents have shown a steady decline from the high of 488 recorded in 2010, followed by 340 in 2011 and 220 in 2012. The security forces killed in terrorism-related incidents is lower than 2013 but higher than the 2011 and 2012 figure. Terrorists, wary of losing ground support, are going after security forces more than civilians. Civilian killings have fallen from 28 in 2014, though they exceeded the levels (15 fatal casualties) seen in 2012 and 2013. The security forces are not taking the higher casualties lying down and are retaliating in equal measure to terrorist attacks. As many as 86 terrorists were killed until October 25, as compared to 67 in 2013 and 72 in 2012. It remains to be seen if the 2015 figure of terrorist killings will surpass the 2014 mark of 110. According to home ministry sources, around 200-220 terrorists/militants, both local and foreign, are estimated to be holed up in the Valley. Though they possess arms, not many are actively engaging security forces in encounters. This could be due to their poor and inadequate training. Earlier, militants could exfiltrate and train at camps in PoK but the heightened vigil by Indian forces at the border has made this a difficult proposition... not many local recruits are well-versed in the use of arms, which has made them less of a worry to the security agencies, a senior officer in the security establishment told TOI. Sources said much of the local recruitment was taking place in Tral and Pulwama. Many of the new recruits are unable to adapt to the hard life of a militant that involves living in the jungles... they are not as committed or hardened and there have been some cases of these terrorists wanting to return to their families, the officer said.","source":"toi","title":"Fewer civilians killed, but terrorist violence up in

Speaking at a meeting of National Human Rights Commission and its state units on Friday, Singh said Yakub was hanged after completion of the judicial process. \"He was convicted by the highest court of the country - the Supreme Court. But in that case also, some people tried to raise the issue of human rights ... I fail to understand why such things are raised,\" he said. \"Some people tend to give importance to the rights of a terrorist over the rights of security forces,\" the minister said adding that India has a healthy democracy but no one could hold the nation to ransom with guns in hands.

The apex court held the final hearing past 2am on July 30. Singh said human rights have been an integral part of Indian culture and Indian saints have highlighted the idea of rights of whole universe, including plants and animals. Singh also expressed concern over prisoners languishing in jails for years before the case is decided. \"It is a serious matter and we all have to address it.

Justice Tahilyani is slated to take up a new assignment as the Lok Ayukta of Maharashtra on August 24. Justice Tahilyani was given a fond farewell by lawyers affiliated to the Advocates Association of Western India (AAWI) in the Bombay high court on Thursday. During his tenure as a sessions judge in Mumbai, Judge Tahilyani had tried many sensational cases, including the murder cases of music baron Gulshan Kumar and trade union leader-MP Datta Samant and also the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack case in which Kasab was executed. Tahaliyani began his career in 1987 as a metropolitan magistrate in a Bandra court. He was appointed as additional sessions judge in Mumbai sessions court in 1997. He was promoted as principal judge in the city's civil and sessions court in early 2000 prior to taking up the assignment in the HC as registrar (inspection). He was appointed as a judge in the 26/11 trial in 2009. He was also posted as a special judge to handle CBI cases. The Supreme Court, in its judgement confirming the Bombay high court order on Kasab's death sentence, praised Justice Tahilyani for exemplary handling of records. The SC observed that \"in the course of hearing of appeal (of Kasab), we also came to know the trial judge M L Tahilyani. From the records of the case, he appears to be stern, no-nonsense person. But he is a true flag-bearer of the rule of law in this country. The manner in which he conducted the trial and maintained the record is exemplary.\" In 2010, Justice Tahilyani was promoted as a judge of the Bombay HC. Felicitating Justice Tahilyani at a function organised by AAWI, senior lawyer S R Chitnis described him as an \"outspoken judge.\" Apart from listening to advocates' arguments, he (Tahilyani) would directly ask questions to the litigants to find out the truth, Chitnis said. In his court, many couples had opted for compromise in domestic violence cases instead of moving on with litigations. \"He always kept the court atmosphere tension-free, which benefitted junior lawyers. He disposed of a large number of appeals under Prevention of Corruption Act,\" said another senior lawyer Ashok Mundargi. _","source":"toi","title":"Judge who gave death to Pak terrorist Kasab retires today","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Judge-who-gave-death-to-Pak-terrorist-Kasab-retires-today/articleshow/48572802.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-08-21","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"NEW DELHI: National Investigation Agency has released sketches of two aides of Pakistani terrorist Mohammed Naved Yakub, who was captured alive by the locals following the attack on a BSF bus in Udhampur district of Jammu on August 5 that left its two personnel dead, Times Now reported on Tuesday. The two aides of Naved are on the run and the NIA has launched a manhunt for them. Mohammed Naved Yakub is undergoing a polygraph test today. The DNA and voice samples of Naved will also be obtained by the NIA. NIA sources said collecting the DNA samples of the militant from Faislabad in Pakistan could help in proving his nationality.

Earlier, the militant gave his written consent for the test, writing in Urdu. Before being brought from Jammu last weekend, Naved, in his 20s, was confronted with other militants from Faislabad lodged in various jails and his interrogators concluded he was not lying about where he hailed from.

He had also given wrong information about the registration plate number of the vehicle that carried him and accomplice Noman to 'Tamatar Modh' on Jammu-Srinagar on August 4, lest it would expose those helping the terror group. Naved has told his interrogators he was often administered psychotropic substances by his Lashkar-e-Taiba handler who motivated him to wage 'Jihad' in India. He was also promised he would be rehabilitated in Pakistan with cash rewards after he carried out 5-6 terror attacks in India. The young militant also told NIA that LeT had threatened his family with dire consequences if they made a hue and cry over his joining the terror network.

This startling revelation came to light during the interrogation of Pakistani national Mohammed Nasir, who allegedly has close links with Jabbar. Nasir along with Bangladeshi nationals Faizal Mohamoud, Joynal Abedin, Maynmarese national Zia Ur Rehman and two local agents \u2014 Masood Ali Khan and Parvez Khan \u2014 was arrested by the Hyderabad police in a pre-dawn swoop at their hideout at Chanchalguda on Friday. Police sources told STOI that Jabbar entered India by illegally crossing the border in Malda and stayed in the country for a few months, probably after the Dilsukhnagar blasts in 2013. However, Jabbar's activities in the country never came under the scanner of either central or state intelligence agencies. \"Nasir disclosed that after Jabbar illegally entered India, they both moved together in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar before the HuJI terrorist slipped back into Bangladesh without any hassle. Jabbar, however, did not visit Hyderabad or other districts of Telangana. We have to probe further what they did and whom they met during Jabbar's stay in India,'' a senior officer, who is part of the investigation team, told STOI. Jabbar, who reportedly has links with Indian Mujahideen (IM) founders Riyaz Bhatkal and Yasin Bhatkal, directed Nasir in January 2014 to help the Dilsukhnagar blast accused Waqas alias Sonu to escape to Bangladesh, the source said. \"Nasir met Waqas and helped him cross the Malda border in West Bengal to reach Bangladesh, unaware of the latter's antecedents. Nasir came to know about the involvement of Waqas in various terror blasts in India only after he was arrested,'' the source added. Nasir, who reportedly has links with human-trafficking gangs, used to grease the palms of officials guarding the border checkpost at Malda and smuggle people in and out of the country. Fugitive Bangladeshi national Noor has become a crucial link for the case as it was he, who during his stay in Zaheerabad of Medak district, introduced the now arrested Sohail Parvez Khan, a resident of Balapur, to Nasir to help the Pakistani settle in Hyderabad. Also, it was Parvez who helped Nasir and his wife get employment at the Unani hospital in Jalapally.","source":"toi","title":"HuJI terrorist Jabbar roamed freely in

Naved Usman alias Qasim Khan of Faisalabad, captured three days ago, was on Saturday brought to the Kashmir Valley to identify those who helped him reach Udhampur where he was arrested, an official said. Usman, a member of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror outfit, was brought to the valley from Jammu region by road, an intelligence officer said. Usman was overpowered by villagers after he and a fellow Pakistani terrorist shot dead two Border Security Force (BSF) troopers on the Jammu-Srinagar highway in Udhampur district on August 5.

Usman is expected to identify the hideouts used by him after he crossed into Jammu and Kashmir's Kupwara district from Pakistan and also the other LeT cadres he met while planning the attack. The NIA has taken over Usman's interrogation to know more about the LeT network in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere in India.

Usman Naved alias Kasim had sneaked in from across the border to kill Amarnath yatris and attack military targets. \"In appreciation of the tremendous bravery and patriotism shown by the two young citizens, namely Rajesh Kumar and Rajesh Sharma, in capturing dreaded terrorist in Jammu area while putting their own lives at risk, I offer Rs 5 lakh to be shared between both of them,\" said the MP in a statement issued here on Thursday. Dhoot further said that his team would get in touch with the villagers in a few days to personally handover the cash prize. Naved had taken three residents of a border village in Udhampur, hostage after attacking a BSF bus on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway, near Udhampur. He asked the villagers to take him to a safe place where he could hide until he got the opportunity to cross over the border. In some time, Naved said that he was hungry and sat down to eat, unwittingly lowering his guard. Sensing an opportunity, Rajesh Kumar, one of the three villagers, grabbed him by the neck while another villager took away the terrorist's gun. The captured terrorist has said that he hailed from Faisalabad, Pakistan and had been on Indian soil for the past 12 days.","source":"toi","title":"MP Dhoot to reward villagers Rs 5 lakh for nabbing Pakistan terrorist","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/MP-Dhoot-to-reward-villagers-Rs-5-lakh-for-nabbing-Pakistan-terrorist/articleshow/48383479.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-08-07","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: In an audacious re-run of the Ajmal Kasab episode after 26/11, Pakistan has disowned Lashkar-e-Taiba jihadi Mohammad Naved who was captured alive after carrying out a terror attack on a BSF bus. Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Syed Qazi Khalilullah dismissed as \"baseless\" Naved's admission about being a resident of Faisalabad. \"We have repeatedly asked India to refrain from accusations,\" he said. \"We have said many times that making immediate accusation on Pakistan is not correct. These things should be based on facts. We expect that whenever Pakistan is being accused of something, it shall be accompanied by concrete evidence.\" READ ALSO: Jihadis step up provocation, spread ops beyond Valley to grab eyeballs The exertions would have carried more credibility had it not been for the details provided by Naved of his Pakistani citizenship and, more importantly, the fact that Pakistan had engaged in similar falsehood the last time a jihadi was caught alive. A newspaper claimed that Naved's father in Pakistan, Mohammed Yakub, confirmed that the jihadi was his son before he abruptly discontinued the conversation saying Lashkar would come after him. \"I'll be killed. The Lashkar is after us and the fauj (army) is after us,\" Yaqub told a newspaper when contacted on a phone number given to the interrogators by Naved. Identifying himself as the \"unfortunate father\" of the attacker, Yakub said, \"You are calling from India. We'll be killed.\" He added, \"The Lashkar is after us. They probably wanted him dead and not caught alive. Please spare him.\" On Thursday, Naved provided his interrogators with more details of his Pakistani citizenship, including the phone numbers of his brother Mohammad Nadeem and his cousin and brother-in-law Mohammad Tahir. READ ALSO: Naved will be taken to Udhampur encounter spot Immediately after his capture, Naved had said one of his brothers taught at Government College, Faisalabad, while another was engaged in the hosiery business. He also told his interrogators that he was launched in India by Lashkar handlers with the instruction to attack military targets and Amarnath yatris. When Ajmal Kasab was caught during the three-day carnage by LeT operatives in Mumbai in 2008, Pakistan brushed aside his acknowledgement about being a Pakistani national who had had been sent to Mumbai on a terror raid. In a stunning replay of Islamabad's anxiety to wash its hands of the 20-year-old who constitutes strong evidence of Pakistan's authorship of jihadi terror directed at India, newspaper reports in the neigbouring country said Naved did not figure in their citizens' database. \"National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) record shows Indian claims of an arrested person, Usman Khan (Mohammed Naved Yakub), originating from Pakistan are totally baseless,\" Pakistani officials were quoted as saying. In 2008, the official line on Kasab was exactly the same until an intrepid reporter from Pakistani news channel Geo travelled to his village in Faridkot to confirm the Indian claims. Following that report, Pakistan had no option but to acknowledge Kasab's nationality. Still, it refused to provide him any legal assistance, even refusing to claim his body after his execution.

BSF jawans retaliated killing Noman while Naved was later captured alive. The Naved story is turning out to be a replay, with Pakistan appearing to be desperate to distance itself from the young jihadi, a \"smoking gun\" in terms of his value as evidence of Pakistan's sponsorship of the terror campaign aimed against India. The story, the person and debates about his identity will be played out during the forthcoming NSA talks if the Pakistani authorities actually agree to come to India.","source":"toi","title":"Admission by captured terrorist Naved\u2019s father blows Pak denial

The society watchman held on firmly to the large black iron gate, warding off reporters who wanted to enter. He had strict instructions from the Memon family in flat number 21 not to let anyone in. Rahin Memon, Yakub's wife, her father and daughter, now all grown up and a graduate who would make any father proud, all stayed indoors. The media vans that descended within minutes stayed a respectable distance away. Few neighbours and college friends of Yakub who hung around simmered with anger at what they said was \"clear injustice to an innocent man.\" Salim Khan, a businessman and local resident, said, \"Why is no one asking why the customs officers are let off so easily? They are the ones who allowed the arms to land that allowed the blasts. We feel sad for the tragic loss of innocent lives, but why is there no death sentence for them, for their corruption. Was that not criminal conspiracy and lack of patriotism by public servants?\" He said the death sentence is \"very harsh\" and said that just because his brother Tiger is absconding, he was paying for it. \"What were the Mahim police doing when activity was allegedly going on in the house which is a stone's throw away? Did they not know anything? He is no terrorist. We are all professional working people here in Mahim.\" Rahin, inconsolable last week after learning about the July 30 execution date, had a prayer on her lips and on her phone. \"Allah knows every single tear you've shed for those you love. He knows the number of times your heart sank out of sadness and grief and undoubtedly. He heard every single 'Ya Allah' that escaped your quivering lips. Never for a moment lose hope in Him, cry to Him for as long as you need, for He is the only one who can turn your tears of sadness into ones of absolute bliss.\" Yakub, special PP Ujjwal Nikam however recalled, never mixed with other accused. \"Others also avoided talking to him, because there was an impression among them that the Memons had betrayed them by having left the country before the blasts, after chalking out all plans for the blasts. Police would be very vigilent in court when the family was present,\" said Nikam adding that \"Yakub would take all notes of court proceedings since he was most educated.

Yakub Memon is a popular figure in Nagpur Central Jail. His congeniality with fellow inmates and guards is on display every year during Eid in the high security 'fasi yard' of the prison, where he has been incarcerated since the Bombay high court confirmed his death sentence pronounced by a Tada court. But the coming Eid may be his last if his curative petition before the Supreme Court is rejected. The warrant of the Tada court set July 30 as the date of his execution. Yakub, the younger brother of 1993 blasts mastermind Tiger Memon, who has been absconding, is humility personified. In jail, he has stayed away from controversies. A chartered accountant, he is a voracious reader and finished his masters in political science last year even as his hopes of escaping the death penalty almost vaporized after President Pranab Mukherjee rejected his mercy plea. Jail sources said Yakub went into a shell for some time after Afzal Guru was hanged in 2013 in the 2001 Parliament attack case. Yakub's zeal to help others was well-known inside the jail. His behaviour even left many wondering if he indeed had a role in the 1993 blasts, which killed 257 people and injured 713. \"Many inmates call him 'sir'. Others address him as 'Yakub bhai'. Even the guards are courteous to him. Seldom does he get into arguments. He prefers silence to protesting if something irks him,\" said a jail source. \"Many inmates consider him a mentor. Others look up to him as a teacher, who is full of wisdom.\" A source who has seen Yakub in the jail's administrative office recalled how the clerical staff approached him for suggestions and he would be ready with solutions. \"Jail staff and inmates working in the office get up from their seats when Yakub walks in,\" said the source. Yakub's counsel Anil Gedam said his client often teaches English and other subjects to inmates and this was included in the mercy petition. \"I found him to be humble whenever I met him,\" Gedam said. A former inmate, who saw the \"soft-spoken\" Yakub during Eid festivities, said that looking at him he \"certainly did not feel that he could be a terrorist\".","source":"toi","title":"Jail inmates find it hard to believe that \u2018Sir\u2019 is a terrorist","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Jail-inmates-find-it-hard-to-believe-that-Sir-is-a-terrorist/articleshow/48092663.cms?"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Jail inmates find it hard to believe that \u2018Sir\u2019 is a terrorist","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Jail-inmates-find-it-hard-to-believe-that-Sir-is-a-terrorist/articleshow/48092663.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-16","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Pak Uses Terrorist Outfits as Proxies, Says US Army General","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pak-uses-terrorist-outfits-as-proxies-says-us-army-general-779949"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"US Senate Bill Would Make Social Media Report 'Terrorist Activity'","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-senate-bill-would-make-social-media-report-terrorist-activity-779583"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-09","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"19.75148","longtitude":"75.713888","location":"Maharashtra"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Maharashtra govt feels threat to LeT terrorist Jundal's life","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Maharashtra-govt-feels-threat-to-LeT-terrorist-Jundals-life/articleshow/47996655.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-07-09","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"19.75148","longtitude":"75.713888","location":"Maharashtra"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"NEW DELHI: There is a threat of assassination of suspected top Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorist Abu Jundal, a key conspirator of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, from 'rival groups' during his transportation from jail to court, the Maharashtra government feels. A trial court, which is hearing terror cases against Jundal, was informed of the Maharashtra government's apprehension by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which has requested the court to expedite the proceedings and conduct the case proceedings through video conferencing so that Jundal is not required to travel from jail to court. The agency, in its plea, also said that because of the threat to Jundal alias Sayed Zabiuddin Ansari, who is presently lodged in Arthur Road jail in Mumbai, he could not be produced before the city court on several occasions despite issuance of production warrants against him. The application for video conferencing was filed before District Judge Amar Nath who is hearing a case in which Jundal was chargesheeted for offences punishable under the IPC and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly attempting to recruit men through Internet for banned outfit, Lashkar-e-Toiba, and conspiring to carry out terror activities in India. NIA had chargesheeted Jundal for allegedly conspiring to carry out terror activities in India, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks and 2006 Aurangabad arms haul case. In the plea, NIA also referred to a resolution passed by the Maharashtra government in May 2013 by which Jundal was excluded from personal appearances in court due to threats of possible bids of assassination or abduction. Referring to the resolution, NIA, in its plea, said, \"exclude the personal appearance of the accused Sayed Zabiuddin Ansari....after taking into consideration the request of the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai to exclude the above-mentioned accused person from personal appearance before court in various cases registered against him due to possibility of assassination bid on the life of accused by rival group or a bid to abduct.\" The agency also told the court that the resolution was challenged by Jundal before Bombay High Court, but his plea was dismissed. \"By virtue of order passed by state government... and order of divisional bench of Bombay High Court... the jail authority is not producing accused Sayed Zabiuddin Ansari... inspite of the production warrant issued by this court directing jail authority to produce the accused before him to answer the charges levelled,\" the NIA application said. The court has issued notice to Jundal's counsel MS Khan and sought his reply on NIA's plea. The case is at the stage of arguments on framing of charges in the case. The court will hear arguments on NIA's plea on July 17. Jundal is considered to be one of the masterminds of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in which the lone arrested accused Ajmal Kasab was convicted and hanged. Jundal was reportedly directing the terrorists during the attacks from the 'control room' in Pak-occupied Kashmir.","source":"toi","title":"Maharashtra govt feels threat to LeT terrorist Jundal's

Nationalist Party (KMT) Tainan city councilors yesterday panned the city government\u2019s removal of Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石) statues from 14 junior-high and elementary schools in the municipality on Saturday, branding Tainan Mayor William Lai (賴清德) a \u201cterrorist\u201d and calling him \u201cEmperor Lai.\u201d KMT city councilors Lu Kun-fu (盧崑福), Wang Chia-chen (王家貞) and Tsai Shu-hui (蔡淑惠) said at a news conference in Tainan that the removal was arbitrarily executed without regard or respect for the schools\u2019 autonomy, adding that Lai\u2019s decision fostered further conflict between members of the pan-green and pan-blue camps. Having the statues wrapped in white cloth prior to removal made them resemble mummies, the councilors said, comparing Lai to the extremist Islamic State group, which has destroyed historical artifacts in Iraq. The city councilors called the operation \u201ctoo secretive,\u201d as the schools were not notified of the removals in advance. In response, Lai said the decision to remove the statues was not made on a whim, as it was announced on Feb. 28 while he was attending a memorial event to mark the 228 Incident. The statues were removed in the interests of transitional justice, Lai said, adding that schools are intended to be places to pass knowledge on to students. \u201cSchools should not be places promoting political adoration, especially the adoration of Chiang,\u201d Lai said. The removals were conducted over the weekend to minimize class disruptions, he said, adding that the workers wrapped the statues to protect them from damage. Opposing opinions are inevitable when a mayor decides to do something, he said, adding that he would gladly listen if such opinions were constructive, but that he would not be baited by aggressive commentary seeking to mislead the public. Separately yesterday, in response to a question posed by Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Lai Chen-chang (賴振昌), Minister of Culture Hung Meng-chi (洪孟啟) said that each statue has its own history, and he urged the nation to refrain from thinking politically about the statues. When Lai Chen-chang further inquired as to whether the presence of Chiang\u2019s statues in school campuses was itself a political consideration, Hung said that \u201chas its own historical background.\u201d","source":"taiwan","title":"Tainan KMT city councilors label mayor a terrorist","url":"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/03/24/2003614292"},"time":{"from":"2015-03-24","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"Yemen Mosques"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"UN Chief Ban Ki-Moon Condemns 'Terrorist Attacks' at Yemen Mosques","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/un-chief-ban-ki-moon-condemns-terrorist-attacks-at-yemen-mosques-748407"},"time":{"from":"2015-03-21","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"32.37870026","longtitude":"75.51439667","location":"Kathua"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"Kathua police station attack: 3 security personnel, 1 terrorist killed","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Kathua-police-station-attack-3-security-personnel-1-terrorist-killed/articleshow/46629462.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-03-20","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"Poison New Zealand Baby Formula"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"'Eco-Terrorist' Threat to Poison New Zealand Baby Formula","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/eco-terrorist-threat-to-poison-new-zealand-baby-formula-745449"},"time":{"from":"2015-03-10","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Police Warn of Terrorist Attack Ahead of Bundesliga Match","url":"http://sports.ndtv.com/article/238296"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"26.820553","longtitude":"30.802498","location":"Egypt"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"ndtv","title":"Egypt Court Declares Hamas 'Terrorist' Group","url":"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/egypt-court-declares-hamas-terrorist-group-743299"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-28","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"23.40601158","longtitude":"79.45809174","location":"India"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"5 Pak intruders slip into India, 1 'trained as terrorist' caught","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/5-Pak-intruders-slip-into-India-1-trained-as-terrorist-caught/articleshow/46319106.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-21","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"unknown","longtitude":"unknown","location":"unknown"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"UNKOWN","source":"toi","title":"British teen convicted of terrorist plan to behead soldier","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/British-teen-convicted-of-terrorist-plan-to-behead-soldier/articleshow/46306859.cms"},"time":{"from":"2015-02-20","toTimeStamp":"null"}},{"geo":{"latitude":"39.904211","longtitude":"116.407395","location":"Beijing"},"newsContent":{"abstract":"The Japanese Embassy in Beijing is warning Japanese nationals living in China of possible terrorist attacks in public locations during the seven-day holidays that started Wednesday in conjunction with the Lunar New Year.
